      <sd>SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITO<name type="GPE">KI</name> with his side exhaust,

<name type="ORG">WATTO</name> begins to worry.</sd>
      <sd>SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through
<name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>'s engines.</sd>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is

	and he's back on course! What a move!</sp>
      <sd>SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>'s tail, crowding
him and pushing him through the turns.</sd>
      <sd>SEBULBA pushes <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> harder, and the young boy has a
difficult time keeping control. One of the parts on <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>'s
engines begins to shake loose. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> sees it and switches
over to an auxiliary system. While he is trying to accomplish
this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.</sd>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move
<name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> makes, SEBULBA is able to block.</sd>
      <sd>Finally, <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> fakes a move into the inside as he usually
does, then tries to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They
race sid by side down the final stretch of the track.</sd>

      <sd>SEBULBA veers toward <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> and bangs into his Pod. He crashes
into <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain
control as the steering rods on the two Pods become hooked
together. SEBULBA laughs at <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>.</sd>

      <sd>As they head for the final stretch, <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> fights to unlock
the steering rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The
strain on the steering rod is tremendous. Suddenly, <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>'s
steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts spinning.</sd>
      <sd>The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue.
One engine EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DES, then the other.  SEBULBA skids through
the fire-balls, blackened, but unhurt. He slides to a smoking
stop, gets out of his racer, and throws what's left of a
shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants
are on fire, and he struggles to put them out.  <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> flies
