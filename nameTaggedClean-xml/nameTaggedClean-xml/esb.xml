      <setting>EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH</setting>
      <sd>A Star <name type="ORG">Destroyer</name> moves through space, releasing <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> probe robots 
from its underside.  </sd>
      <sd>One of these probes zooms toward the planet <name type="GPE">Hoth</name> and lands on its ice-
covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of
impact.  </sd>
      <setting>EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY</setting>
      <sd>A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A 
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the 
smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the 
snow plain and disappears into the distance.</sd>
      <setting>EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY</setting>
      <sd>A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled 
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a <name type="PERSON">Taun</name>taun.  Curving 
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged 
beast.</sd>
      <sd>The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling 
off his protective goggles, <name type="PERSON">Luke</name>
         <name type="PERSON">Skywalker</name> notices something in the 
sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and 
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.</sd>
      <sd>The wind whips at <name type="PERSON">Luke</name>'s fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink 
transmitter.  His <name type="PERSON">Taun</name>taun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.</sd>

         <speaker>LUKE</speaker>

		Echo Three to Echo Seven.  <name type="PERSON">Han</name>, 
		old buddy, do you read me?</sp>
      <sd>After a little static a familiar voice is heard.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
			(over comlink)
		Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LUKE</speaker>
			(into comlink)
		Well, I finished my circle.  I 
		don't pick up any life readings.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
			(over comlink)
		There isn't enough life on this 
		ice cube to fill a space cruiser.  
		The sensors are placed, I'm going 
		back.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LUKE</speaker>
			(into comlink)
		Right.  I'll see you shortly.  
		There's a meteorite that hit the 
		ground near here.  I want to check 
		it out.  It won't take long.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Luke</name> clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.  
He pats the beast on the head to calm it.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Hey, steady girl.  What's the 
		matter?  You smell something?</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Luke</name> takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when 
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a 
monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over 
him.  It is a <name type="ORG">Wampa</name> Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LUKE</speaker>
		Aaargh!</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Luke</name> grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white 
claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified 
screams of the <name type="PERSON">Taun</name>taun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck 
being broken.</sd>
      <sd>
         <name type="ORG">The Wampa Ice Creature</name> grabs <name type="PERSON">Luke</name> by one ankle and drags him away 
across the frozen plain.</sd>
      <setting>EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY</setting>
      <sd>A stalwart figure rides his <name type="PERSON">Taun</name>taun up to the entrance of an enormous 
ice cave.</sd>
      <setting>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK</setting>
      <sd>Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing 
their new base.  The rider, <name type="PERSON">Han</name>
         <name type="PERSON">Solo</name>, swings off his lizard and pulls 
off his goggles.</sd>
      <sd>He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium <name type="ORG">Falcon</name>, which 
is parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various 
other <name type="ORG">droids</name> hurry about.  <name type="PERSON">Han</name> stops at the Millennium <name type="ORG">Falcon</name> where his 
<name type="NORP">Wookiee</name> copilot, <name type="PERSON">Chewbacca</name>, is welding on a central lifter.  <name type="PERSON">Chewie</name> 
stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated 
greeting to his boss.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
         <name type="PERSON">Chewie</name>!</sp>
      <sd>The <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name> grumbles a reply.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		All right, don't lose your temper.
		I'll come right back and give you 
		a hand.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Chewbacca</name> puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as <name type="PERSON">Han</name> 
leaves.</sd>
      <setting>INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER</setting>
      <sd>A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick 
ice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers, 
troops, and <name type="ORG">droids</name> move about setting up electronic eq<name type="ORG">uip</name>ment and 
monitoring radar signals.</sd>
      <sd>
         <name type="ORG">General Rieekan</name> straightens up from a console at <name type="PERSON">Han</name>'s approach.</sd>

         <name type="PERSON">Solo</name>?</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll 
know if anything comes around.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>RIEEKAN</speaker>
		Commander <name type="PERSON">Skywalker</name> reported in yet?</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		No.  He's checking out a meteorite 
		that hit near him.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>RIEEKAN</speaker>
			(indicates radar 
			 screen)
		With all the meteor activity in this
		system, it's going to be difficult 
		to spot approaching ships.</sp>
      <sd>Taking a deep breath, <name type="PERSON">Han</name> blurts out what is on his mind.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		General, I've got to leave.  I 
		can't stay anymore.</sp>
      <sd>Princess <name type="PERSON">Leia</name>, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short 
white combat jacket and pants.  Her hair is braided across her head in 
a <name type="NORP">Nordic</name> fashion.  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat 
distressed.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>RIEEKAN</speaker>
		I'm sorry to hear that.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Well, there's a price on my head.
		If I don't pay off <name type="PERSON">Jabba</name> the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>, 
		I'm a dead man.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>RIEEKAN</speaker>
		A death mark's not an easy thing 
		to live with.  You're a good
		fighter, <name type="PERSON">Solo</name>.  I hate to lose you.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Thank you, General.</sp>
      <sd>He turns to <name type="PERSON">Leia</name> as <name type="NORP">Rieekan</name> moves away.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
			(with feeling)
		Well, Your Highness, I guess this

      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		That's right.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Leia</name> is angry.  <name type="PERSON">Han</name> sees she has no warmth to offer him.  He shakes his 
head and adopts a sarcastic tone.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
			(cooly)
		Well, don't get all mushy on me.
		So long, Princess.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Han</name> walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.  
<name type="PERSON">Leia</name> stews a moment, then hurries after him.</sd>

         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Yes, Your Highnessness?</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		I thought you decided to stay.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Well, the bounty hunter we ran

      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
         <name type="PERSON">Han</name>, we need you!</sp>
      <sp>

      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		Yes.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Oh, what about you need?</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
			(mystified)
		I need?  I don't know what you're

      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
			(shakes his head, 
			 fed up) 
		You probably don't.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		And what precisely am I supposed 
		to know?</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Come on!  You want me to stay 
		because of the way you feel about
		me.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		Yes.  You're a great help to us.
		You're a natural leader...</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		No!  That's not it.  Come on.  
		Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Leia</name> stares at him, understanding, then laughs.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
You're imagining things.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		Am I?  Then why are you following 
		me?  Afraid I was going to leave
		without giving you a goodbye kiss?</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		I'd just as soon kiss a <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I can arrange that.  You could use

      <sd>Angrily, <name type="PERSON">Han</name> strides down the corridor as <name type="PERSON">Leia</name> stares after him.</sd>

		Don't try to blame me.  I didn't

      <sd>The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of 
a <name type="GPE">Hoth</name> day.  <name type="PERSON">Luke</name> hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy 
stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One 
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens

gorge walls.  <name type="PERSON">Luke</name> pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and 
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.</sd>

himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The

rebuffs him.</sd>

      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I do, I really do.  You could be

		Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you

      <sd>She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		Occasionally...

      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>

      <sd>With that, <name type="PERSON">Han</name> takes her hand and starts to massage it.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>

         <speaker>HAN</speaker>

      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Leia</name> is flushes, confused.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		Stop that!  My hands are dirty.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		My hands are dirty, too.  What 
		are you afraid of?</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
			(looking right

		Afraid?</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Han</name> looks at her with a piercing look.  He's never looked more 
handsome, more dashing, more confident.  He reaches out slowly and 
takes <name type="PERSON">Leia</name>'s hand again from where it is resting on a console.  He 
draws it toward him.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		You're trembling.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		I'm not trembling.</sp>
      <sd>Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength and 
emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw <name type="PERSON">Leia</name> toward him... 
very slowly.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
		There aren't enough scoundrels in 
		your life.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Leia</name> is now very close to <name type="PERSON">Han</name> and as she speaks, her voice becomes an 
excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to her words.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		I happen to like nice men.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>HAN</speaker>
		I'm a nice man.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>LEIA</speaker>
		No, you're not.  You're...</sp>
      <sd>He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips.  He takes his time, as though 
he had forever, bending her body backward.  She has never been kissed 
like this before, and it almost makes her faint.  When he stops, she 
regains her breath and tries to work up some indignation, but finds it 
hard to talk.</sd>
      <sd>Suddenly, <name type="PERSON">Threepio</name> appears in the doorway, speaking excitedly.</sd>

thick glass windows.  As rain tap-dances a merry tune on <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>'s head,

the glowing portals.</sd>
      <setting>INT. CREATURE'S HOUSE</setting>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house - a very 
plain, but cozy dwelling.  Everything is in the same small scale as the 
creature.  The only thing out of place in the miniature room is <name type="PERSON">Luke</name>, 
whose height makes the four-foot ceiling seem even lower.  He sits 
cross-legged on the floor of the living room.</sd>
      <sd>The creature is in an adjoining area - his little kitchen - cooking up 
an incredible meal.  The stove is a steaming hodgepodge of pots and 
pans.  The wizened little host scurries about chopping this, shredding 
that, and showering everything with exotic herbs and spices.  He rushes 
back and forth putting platters on the table in front of <name type="PERSON">Luke</name>, who 
watches the creature impatiently.</sd>

         <name type="PERSON">Chewbacca</name> is in a <name type="GPE">Cloud City</name> prison cell.  The stark room is flooded 
with hot light.  To add to <name type="PERSON">Chewie</name>'s misery, a high-pitched whistle 
screeches loudly.  <name type="PERSON">Chewie</name> is going mad.  He hits the wall with giant 
fists as he paces back and forth across the cell floor.  The upper 
lights go off abruptly.  The prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a 
wall, where he listens for a moment.  Then, moaning to himself, he 
moves to a platform where the disassembled pieces of <name type="PERSON">Threepio</name> lie.  He 
picks up <name type="FAC">the golden droid</name>'s head and meditates on it for a moment, 
barking a few philosophical remarks.  <name type="PERSON">Chewie</name> sticks the robot's head on 
its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits.</sd>
      <sd>Suddenly, the lights in <name type="PERSON">Threepio</name>'s eyes spark to life as <name type="PERSON">Chewie</name> touches 
two connectors together.  <name type="PERSON">Threepio</name> immediately begins to speak, but his 
voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly unintelligible.</sd>

         <name type="PERSON">Chewie</name> looks at <name type="PERSON">Threepio</name> in bewilderment, then scratches his furry

collapse.  <name type="PERSON">Luke</name> moves to the edge and looks down, but sees no sign of
