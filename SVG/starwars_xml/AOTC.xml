Several hundred solar systems under
the leadership of the rebel leader, <name type="ORG">Count</name>
         <name type="PERSON">Dooku</name>, have decalred their intentions to
secede from the Republic.
This separatist movement has made it
difficult for the limited number of
<name type="GPE">Jedi Kights</name> to maintain peace and
order in the galaxy.
<name type="PERSON">Senator</name>
         <name type="PERSON">Amidala</name>, the former <name type="PERSON">Queen</name> of
<name type="LOC">Naboo</name>, is returning to <name type="LOC">Coruscant</name>
to vote on the critical issue
of creating an army to assist the
overwhelmed Jedi.</crawl>
      <sd>
         <name type="ORG">PAN</name> UP to reveal the amber city planet of <name type="LOC">Coruscant</name>. A yellow <name type="LOC">Naboo</name> Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large <name type="ORG">Royal Cruiser</name> and two more Fighters.</sd>

      <sd>The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek <name type="LOC">Naboo</name> spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.</sd>
      <setting>EXT. CORUSCANT, LANDING PLATFORM - DAWN</setting>
      <sd>Two <name type="LOC">Naboo</name> Fighters land on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.</sd>
      <sd>A small <name type="ORG">GROUP</name> OF <name type="ORG">DIGNITARIES</name> waits to welcome the <name type="PERSON">Senator</name>. One of the members of the group os a well dressed <name type="ORG">JAR</name>

      <sd>One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN <name type="ORG">TYPHO</name>, <name type="PERSON">SENATOR</name> PADME'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.</sd>

      <sd>The <name type="ORG">DIGNITARIES</name> start to move forward. <name type="PERSON">SENATOR</name> PADME reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge <name type="ORG">EXPLOSION</name>. The <name type="ORG">DIGNITARIES</name> and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.</sd>
      <sd>Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN <name type="ORG">TYPHO</name> and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where <name type="PERSON">SENATOR</name> PADME lies dying. Beyond, <name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> DETOO drops down from the <name type="LOC">Naboo</name> Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by <name type="PERSON">SENATOR</name> PADME and takes off her helmet, revealing <name type="PERSON">SENATOR</name> PADME PADME.</sd>

				(continued)
			This grievous blow is especially
			personal to me. Before I became
			Chancellor, I served <name type="PERSON">Amidala</name> when
			she was <name type="PERSON">Queen</name>. She was a great
			leader who fought for justice, not
			only in this honourable assembly,
			but also on her home planet. She
			was so loved she could have been
			elected queen for life. She
			believed in public service, and
			she fervently believed in
			democracy. Her death is a great
			loss to us all. We will all mourn
			her as a relentless champion of
			freedom... and as a dear friend.</sp>
      <sd>There is a moment of silence. <name type="ORG">ASK AAK</name>, the <name type="PERSON">SENATOR</name> of <name type="ORG">MALASTARE</name>, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.</sd>

         <speaker>PADME</speaker>
			Less than an hour ago, an
			assassination attempt was made
			against my life. One of my
			bodyguards and six  others were
			ruthlessly and senselessly
			murdered. I was the target but,
			more importantly, I believe this
			security measure before you, was
			the target. I have led the
			opposition to build an army... but
			there is someone in this body who
			will stop at nothing to assure it's
			passage...</sp>
      <sd>Many of the <name type="PERSON">SENATOR</name>S boo and yell at <name type="PERSON">SENATOR</name> PADME.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>PADME</speaker>
			 	(continuing)
			I warn you, if you vote to create
			this army, war will follow. I
			have experienced the misery of war 
			first-hand; I do not wish to do it
			again.</sp>
      <sd>There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>PADME</speaker>
			Wake up, <name type="PERSON">Senator</name>s... you must wake
			up! If you offer the separatists
			violence, they can only show us
			violence in return! Many will
			lose their lives. All will lose
			their freedom. This decision
			could very well destroy the very
			foundation of our great Republic.
			I pray you do not let fear push
			you into a disastrous decision.
			Vote down this security measure,
			which is nothing less than a
			declaration of war! Does anyone
			here want that? I cannot believe
			they do.</sp>
      <sd>There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. <name type="PERSON">SENATOR</name>

It takesthe <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> wildly between buildings and finally skims across a rooftop as OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is forced to lift his legs, tenaciously hanging onto the DROID. The DROID heads for a dirty, beat-up speeder hidden in an alcove of a building about twenty stories up. When the pilot of the speeder, a scruffy bounty hunter called <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> WESELL, sees the DROID approach with OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> hanging on, she pulls a long rifle out of the speeder and starts to fire at the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name>. <name type="ORG">EXPLOSION</name>S burst all around OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>
			I have a bad feeling about this.</sp>
      <sd>FINALLY, the DROID suffers a direct hit and blows up. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> falls fifty stories, until a speeder drops down next to him, and he manages to grab onto the back end of the speeder and haul himself toward the cockpit. The <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> struggles to climb into the passenger seat of the open speeder and sit down next to the driver, <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>.</sd>

            <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>
         </speaker>
			Oh, you know, Master, I couldn't

      <sd>They zoom upward in hot pursuit of <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> asshe fires out the open window at them with her laser pistol.</sd>

			Only in your mind, my very young

      <sd>As this conversation is going on, <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> deftly moves in and out of the oncoming traffic, across lanes, between buildings, and miraculously through a construction site. <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> WESELL continues firing at them.</sd>

      <sd>
         <name type="ORG">ZAM</name>
         <name type="ORG">WESSEL</name> and the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> race through a line of cross-traffic made up of giant trucks. The speeders bank sideways as they slide around right-angle turns between buildings. <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> races into a tram tunnel.</sd>

      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> zooms into the tunnel after <name type="ORG">ZAM</name>. They see a tram coming at them. They brake, turn around, and race out, barely ahead of the charging commuter transport.</sd>

      <sd>
         <name type="ORG">ZAM</name>
         <name type="ORG">WESSEL</name> turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> and the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name>. <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name>. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> slams on the brakes and moves alongside <name type="ORG">ZAM</name>. She now fires point-blank at OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>

			Right - this isn't working.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> slides underneath <name type="PERSON">Zam</name>'s speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> to drop behind. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>

            <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>
         </speaker>
			Clear the flag! We're losing
			power! Hurry!</sp>
      <sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> leans out of the speeder, then crawls out onto the front engine, pulling the flag free of the scoop. The speeder lurches forward with a surge of power.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>
			Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I

      <sd>They chase the BOUNTY HUNTER through a power refinery.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>
			It's dangerous near those power

      <sd>Huge electrical bolts shoot between the buildings as the speeders pass.</sd>

      <sd>
         <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> slides around a corner sideways, blocking an alley, firing point-blank as <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> approaches.</sd>

      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant <name type="ORG">gasball</name> shoots up, causing <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.</sd>

         <speaker>
            <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>
         </speaker>
			I think we're still alive.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> works to get the speeder started. It quickly races to life.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>

         <speaker>
            <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>

         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>
				(furious)
			But you didn't!!! And now we've
			lost him.</sp>
      <sd>Suddenly, there is an ambush. Laser bolts fire everywhere. <name type="ORG">EXPLOSION</name>S surround them. They look up to see <name type="ORG">ZAM</name>
         <name type="ORG">WESSEL</name> take off.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>
            <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>
         </speaker>
			No we didn�t...</sp>
      <sd>Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> tear after <name type="ORG">ZAM</name>. They are smoking. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> turns down and left between two buildings. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> pulls up and to the right</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>
			Where are you going?! He went

         <speaker>
            <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>

      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>

      <sp>
         <speaker>
            <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>
         </speaker>
			Master, if we keep this chase

      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>
				(sarcastic)
			Oh, so that�s why we�re going in

      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>
         </speaker>
				(continuing)
			Well, you lost him.</sp>
      <sp>
         <speaker>
            <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>
         </speaker>
			I�m deeply sorry, Master.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to 
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>
            <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>
         </speaker>
				(continuing)
			Excuse me for a moment.</sp>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> jumps out of the speeder. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> looks down and sees <name type="PERSON">Zam</name>�s speeder about five stories below them cruising past. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> miraculously lands on top of <name type="PERSON">the Bounty Hunter</name>�s speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> looks up and realises what has happened.</sd>
      <sd>
         <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> takes off, and <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> works his way back to the speeder�s cockpit, just as <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> stops suddenly, and <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> flies forward to the left front fork. <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> slides to the right fork of the speeder, where <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> can�t reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.</sd>
      <sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> has jumped into the driver�s seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless <name type="FAC">JEDI</name>, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> races under the speeder and catches <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> weapon in the passenger�s seat.</sd>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, pulls the gun out of <name type="ORG">ZAM</name>�S hand. She grabs <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>�s hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> struggles to pull the speeder out of it�s nose dive. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of <name type="PERSON">the Bounty Hunter</name>�s speeder.</sd>
      <sd>Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> goes flying into the street.</sd>
      <setting>EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT</setting>
      <sd>
         <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> exits the crashed speeder and runs. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.</sd>
      <sd>It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, <name type="ORG">PAN</name>HANDLING <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.</sd>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing <name type="ORG">ZAM</name>. He loses <name type="PERSON">the Bounty Hunter</name> in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.</sd>
      <sd>Ahead, <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> turns in through a door and disappears.</sd>
      <sd>A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> is just about to follow <name type="ORG">ZAM</name> when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. <name type="PERSON">PEOPLE</name> start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> gets out and walks over, holding out <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>'S lightsaber.</sd>

			Popular rule is not democracy,

      <sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves.

      <sd>PADME has turned around and is pulling herself up by the chain to the top of the post. Within a moment, she is standing on top of it, trying to pull the chain free.</sd>

      <sd>The REEK charges <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>. He jumps up, and the beast hits the post hard. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> lands onto its back, wrapping part of his chain around its horn. The REEK backs off, shaking its head angrily, which tears the chain from the post</sd>
      <sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> ducks around the post as the <name type="PERSON">ACKLAY</name> charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> sprawling. The <name type="PERSON">ACKLAY</name> crunches the post between its claws, freeing the chain. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> leaps up and runs towards ONE of the <name type="ORG">PICADOR</name>S. The <name type="PERSON">ACKLAY</name> taks off after him.</sd>
      <sd>The <name type="LOC">NEXU</name> arrives at PADME'S post and rears on its hind legs. One top, PADME struggles to tear the chain free. The <name type="LOC">NEXU</name>
         <name type="ORG">ROAR</name>S, displaying wicked, dripping fangs.</sd>

      <sd>In the arena, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> runs at the <name type="ORG">PICADOR</name>. The ORRAY rears up. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> grabs the <name type="ORG">PICADOR</name>'S long spear and pole vaults over him. The chasing <name type="PERSON">ACKLAY</name> smashes into the ORRAY. It goes down. The <name type="ORG">PICADOR</name> tumbles onto the sand, where he is grabbed by the <name type="PERSON">ACKLAY</name> and crunched.</sd>
      <sd>
         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name>'s REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.</sd>
      <sd>The <name type="LOC">NEXU</name>'s claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.</sd>

      <sd>In the arena, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> runs out from behind the fallen ORRAY and throws the spear at the <name type="PERSON">ACKLAY</name>, hitting it in the neck.

The REEK charges away, around the arena. The <name type="LOC">NEXU</name> bounds after it. The REEK passes the wounded <name type="PERSON">ACKLAY</name>. The <name type="LOC">NEXU</name> smells the blood and turns aside to attack the <name type="PERSON">ACKLAY</name>. The TWO <name type="ORG">MON</name>STERS fight.

      <sd>COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> charges across the space at YODA. He rains down blows upon the tiny figure. YODA doesn't budge an inch. For the first part of the contest, he parries every cut and thrust that <name type="PERSON">Dooku</name> aims. Nothing the great swordsman tries gets through. His energy drains. His strokes become feebler, slower.</sd>
      <sd>YODA attacks! He flies forward. COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> is forced to retreat. Wprds are insufficient to describe the range and skill of <name type="PERSON">Yoda</name>'s speed and swordplay. His lightsaber his a humming blur of light.</sd>
      <sd>
         <name type="ORG">Count</name>
         <name type="PERSON">Dooku</name>'s lightsaber is sent cartwheeling from his hand. He staggers back, gasping and spent, against the control panel.

      <sd>COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> raises his arms and knocks YODA off his shoulders and then, with all his might, he uses the <name type="ORG">Force</name> to pull on one of the cranes in the hanger.

         <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> is unconscious, and OBI0<name type="ORG">WAN</name> tries toget out from under the crane. The fallen crane trembles and starts to life. Behind it, the sound of the Sail Ship's engines are heard starting up.</sd>
      <sd>YODA concentrates harder. Slowly, the crane rises. The SOUND OF THE <name type="ORG">ENGINES</name> increases. YODA exerts every scrap of his powers. The crane lifts clear of <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> and is thrown to the ground. <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name>'S Sail Ship takes off. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> and <name type="PERSON">ANAKIN</name> struggle to the exhausted YODA, but it's too late. The Sail Ship rises into the air and flies away.
