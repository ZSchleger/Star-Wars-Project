<crawl>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.</crawl>

<sd>A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for <name type="ORG">the Main</name> Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.</sd>

<crawl>War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, <name type="ORG">Count</name> <name type="PERSON">Dooku</name>. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.

In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor <name type="PERSON">Palpatine</name>, leader of the <name type="NORP">Galactic</name> <name type="LOC">Senate</name>.

As the <name type="NORP">Separatist</name> <name type="ORG">Droid</name> Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi <name type="ORG">Knights</name> lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . .
</crawl>

<sd><name type="ORG">PAN</name> DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to <name type="ORG">PAN</name> with the Cruiser as TWO <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>'s ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.</sd>

<setting>2 INT. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-<name type="LOC">SPACE</name></setting>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.</sd>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Look out, four <name type="NORP">droids</name> inbound . . .</sp>

<setting>4 EXT. CORUSCANT-<name type="LOC">SPACE</name> <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name></setting>

<sd>The TWO <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.</sd>

<setting>5 INT. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-<name type="LOC">SPACE</name></setting>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> struggles to maintain control of his ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> We've got to split them up.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> flies to the left of a huge tower on a <name type="LOC">REPUBLIC CRUISER</name>. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, they're all over me!</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name> . . .</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> BEEPS his reply as <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> swoops in for the kill. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DES.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing, laughs) We got him, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>!</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as <name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> BEEPS an angry warning.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I copy, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> I'm going down on the deck.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name>SHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>, lock on! Lock on!</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Hurry up! I don't like this!</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a <name type="ORG">Battleship</name>. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro <name type="ORG">Droid</name>, ARFOUR.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> (continuing) Ouch!</sp>

<sd>R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> We're locked on ... we've got him . . .</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. <name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> SQUEALS with delight.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find <name type="FAC">the Command Ship</name> and get on with it ...</sp>

<sd>R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Lock onto them, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>. Master, <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>'s ship is directly ahead.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>'s cockpit.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing) The one crawling with vulture <name type="NORP">droids</name>.</sp>

<setting>6 INT. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-<name type="LOC">SPACE</name></setting>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.</sp>

<sd>Ahead is a <name type="LOC">TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</name> with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> STARFIGHTERS.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Come on, Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL</speaker> (OS) Copy, <name type="PERSON">Red Leader</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .</sp>

<setting>7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-<name type="LOC">SPACE</name></setting>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL</speaker> We're on your tail, General <name type="PERSON">Kenobi</name>. Set S-foils in attack position.</sp>

<sd>The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the <name type="LOC">TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</name>, and six new DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>. The <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.</sd>

<setting>8 INT. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name>'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-<name type="LOC">SPACE</name></setting>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture <name type="ORG">Droid</name>s straight ahead, coming down the left side.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> BEEPS a worried message.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I'm going head to head. See you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Take it easy, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>.</sp>

<sd>Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL</speaker> I'm on your right, <name type="PERSON">Red Leader</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Incoming!!</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> SQUEALS as five DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Five more on the right!</sp>

<sd>Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> and <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. <name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> SQUEALS.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Here we go.</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DE.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> I'm going high and right.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Han</name>g on. There are four more of them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> All right, engage . . . and hurry. These <name type="NORP">droids</name> are all over me like a rash.</sp>

<sd>In one incredible move, <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> swings in behind the DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. <name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> CHIRPS.</sd>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> lets out a <name type="GPE">HOWL</name> as <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> accelerates past the last DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. <name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> looks behind him.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> How many back there. <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>? (<name type="PERSON">Artoo</name> beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, you have four on your tail.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I know. I know!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Four more closing from your left.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I know. I know!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Break right and go high.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I'm going low and left.</sp>

<sd>Obi-Wan shakes his head.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> (to himself) He still has much to learn.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name>SHIP, dodging flack as <name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Han</name>g on, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name>, BLASTING four of them away. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name> <name type="ORG">Battleship</name>s. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> (continuing) You'll never get through there, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. It's too tight.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> BEEPS nervously.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Easy, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name> . . . we've done this before.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Use the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, think yourself through, the ship will follow.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>'s squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Wrong thought, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing) I'm through.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the <name type="ORG">EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name><name type="ORG">SIO</name>N</name>.
A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.
Finally, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name>. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL</speaker> There are too many of them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE PILOT 2</speaker> I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I'm going to go help them out!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for <name type="FAC">the Command Ship</name>!</sp>

<sd>Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Missiles! Pull up!</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> break right and left, and the missiles follow them. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> They overshot us . . .</sp>

<sd>The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan�s Fighter and EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the <name type="ORG">Starfighter</name> rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> They're coming around!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Surge all power units. <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>! Stand by the reverse thrusters.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> We got 'em. <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>!</sp>

<sd>Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Flying is for <name type="NORP">droids</name>.</sp>

<sd>Suddenly, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name> Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL <name type="PERSON">BUZZ<name type="NORP">DROIDS</name></name> that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> (continuing) I'm hit! <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I see them . . . Buzz <name type="ORG">Droid</name>s.</sp>

<sd>The BUZZ <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> break into the wiring. One of <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> goes after ARFOUR.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .</sp>

<sd>ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> The mission. Get to <name type="FAC">the Command Ship</name>. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> crawling over Obi-Wan�s <name type="ORG">Starfighter</name>. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name>, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> (continuing) In the name of ...</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Steady . . . steady . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Move to the right.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Hold on, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I'm not leaving without you, Master.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> moves his ship next to OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'s and tries to physically knock <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'s ship in the process. One of <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>'s view.</sd>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> knocks off three of <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> and the fourth crawls out onto <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>'s ship and starts attacking <name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name>. <name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> fights <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> DROID.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Get 'em, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>. Watch out!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>, hit the buzz droid's center eye.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ARTOO</name> extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Yeah, you got him!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Great, <name type="PERSON">Artoo</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Stay on my wing . . . <name type="ORG">the General</name>'s Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Have you noticed the shields are still up?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Oh?!? Sorry, Master.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> streaks ahead of OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'s disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DES.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.</sp>

<setting>9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-<name type="LOC">TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</name></setting>

<sd>The shield door drops away, and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a <name type="ORG">FANTA</name>IL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts <name type="ORG">SLAM</name>MING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.</sd>

<sd>As a dozen more <name type="NORP">droids</name> join the group, the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.</sd>

<sd>The TWO <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge <name type="ORG">EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name><name type="ORG">SIO</name>N</name>S outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> get up and turn off their light sabers. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Well then, we're safe for the time being.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.</sp>

<sd>They run, <name type="ORG">EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name><name type="ORG">SIO</name>N</name>S rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF <name type="FAC">SHIELD</name> DOORS CLOSING AND LOC<name type="GPE">KI</name>NG ECHO throughout the hallway.

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> They're sealing this section off.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.</sp>

<sd>They move along a wall. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPAR<name type="GPE">KI</name>NG dischargers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> We'll never get through that. It's too small!</sp>

<sd>They move toward a second vent. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name>. It pulls <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> disables the SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.</sd>

<sd>The fuel is up to <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>'s chins. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I found our escape vent.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> swim closer.</sd>

<sd>As the SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name> reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.</sd>

<setting>14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-<name type="LOC">TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</name></setting>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.</sp>

<name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> and COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of <name type="ORG">the General</name>'s Quarters, <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> leaps over COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name>. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="NORP">DROIDS</name>. COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> holds OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> in the air using the <name type="ORG">Force</name> as he turns and kicks <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> out of frame.

<name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> hits the archway.
<name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> sends OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> flying. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> spins around again and, using the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> spins and kicks COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name>, sending him over the balcony. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> Jumps, following him down to the main floor.

<sd><name type="PERSON">Anakin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Dooku</name> continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> cuts off COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name>'s hands. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> stumbles to the floor as <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> puts the two lightsabers to his neck. <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> is grinning as he watches COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name>'s defeat.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Good, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I shouldn't . . .</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> cuts off COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name>'s head. A huge <name type="ORG">EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name><name type="ORG">SIO</name>N</name> somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> ... I couldn't stop myself.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> You did well, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> drops COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name>'s lightsaber, moving to <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> raises his hands toward <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name>, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> way.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> stands up, rubbing his wrists.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security <name type="NORP">droids</name> arrive.</sp>

<sd>The ship begins to list to one side. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> rushes over to OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free.

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> (continuing) <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.</sp>

OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is unable to cut the staff. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.
OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD'S head.

PADME descends the stairs and joins <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> What's bothering you?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Nothing . . .</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> touches the <name type="PERSON">japor</name> snippet around PADME'S neck, that <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name> gave her when he was a small boy.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> It was a dream.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Tell me.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> It was only a dream.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> It was only a dream.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> takes PADME in his arms.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> . . . I won't let this one become real, <name type="PERSON">Padme</name>.</sp>

<sd>They embrace, then part.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, this baby will change our lives.

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (suspicious) Have you told him anything?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> He's been a father to me, but he's still on the <name type="ORG">Council</name>. Don't tell him anything!</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Yes.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> Careful you must be when sensing the future, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I won't let these visions come true, Master <name type="PERSON">Yoda</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the <name type="ORG">Force</name>. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> What's wrong then?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> The <name type="LOC">Senate</name> is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the <name type="ORG">Council</name> and the Chancellor are stressed.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I know the <name type="ORG">Council</name> has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, this afternoon the <name type="LOC">Senate</name> is going to call on me to take direct control of <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Council</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> will no longer report to the <name type="LOC">Senate</name>?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> They will report to me . . . personally. The <name type="LOC">Senate</name> is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I agree, but <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Council</name> may not see it that way.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> With all due respect, sir, the <name type="ORG">Council</name> is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Everyone will agree on that.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ...

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I fear <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>. The <name type="ORG">Council</name> keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I can assure you that <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> <name type="PERSON">ORGANA</name></speaker> I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a <name type="NORP">Separatist</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MON</name> MOTHMA</speaker> We are not <name type="NORP">Separatist</name>s trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> <name type="PERSON">ORGANA</name></speaker> It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor <name type="PERSON">Palpatine</name> is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was <name type="PERSON">Queen</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>GlDDEAN DA<name type="ORG">NU</name>:</speaker> <name type="PERSON">Senator</name>, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the <name type="LOC">Senate</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MON</name> MOTHMA</speaker> The Chancellor has played the <name type="PERSON">Senator</name>s well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. <name type="PERSON">Palpatine</name> has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> <name type="PERSON">ORGANA</name></speaker> We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. <name type="PERSON">Senator</name> <name type="PERSON">Mon Mothma</name> and I are putting together an organization . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Say no more. <name type="PERSON">Senator</name> <name type="PERSON">Organa</name>. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> <name type="PERSON">ORGANA</name></speaker> Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MON</name> MOTHMA</speaker> That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> We cannot take ships from the front line.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> Master <name type="PERSON">Kenobi</name>, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="GPE">KI</name>-ADI-MUNDI</speaker> What about the droid attack on the <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>s?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the <name type="NORP">droids</name> off that planet.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> <name type="PERSON">Skywalker</name>, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and <name type="PERSON">Kenobi</name> must find <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, the only reason the <name type="ORG">Council</name> has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> And?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> What situation?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> (takes a deep breath) The <name type="ORG">Council</name> wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> We are at war, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Council</name> is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Why didn't the <name type="ORG">Council</name> give me this assignment when we were in session?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> This assignment is not to be on record. The <name type="ORG">Council</name> asked me to approach you on this personally.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> That is why you must help us, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. Our allegiance is to the <name type="LOC">Senate</name>, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Master, the <name type="LOC">Senate</name> demanded that he stay longer.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Yes, but use your feelings, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. Something is out of place.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> You're asking me to do something against <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> The <name type="ORG">Council</name> is asking you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name> did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker>I wish I did.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the <name type="ORG">Force</name>?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> So the prophecy says.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> He will not let me down. He never has.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> I hope right you are. And now destroy the <name type="ORG">Droid</name> armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the <name type="ORG">Force</name> be with you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Thank you, Captain.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN <name type="ORG">TYPHO</name></speaker> Rest well. My Lady.</sp>

<sd>CAPTAIN <name type="ORG">TYPHO</name> gets back into the <name type="ORG">Speeder</name>, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, <name type="ORG">Motee</name> and <name type="ORG">Elle</name>, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A <name type="ORG">FIGURE</name> moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> I'll be up in a while.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MOTEE</name>:</speaker> Yes, my lady.</sp>

<sd>C-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">THREEPIO</name></speaker> Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Yes, make sure all the security <name type="NORP">droids</name> are working. Thank you, <name type="PERSON">Threepio</name>.</sp>

<sd>The golden droid turns and exits.</sd>

<sd>PADME stands and watches the sunset. The <name type="ORG">SHADOWY</name> <name type="ORG">FIGURE</name> moves toward her. She senses something.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Beautiful, isn't it?</sp>

<sd>PADME jumps and turns around.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> You startled me.</sp>

<sd>He sits next to her on the bench.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> How are you feeling?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> He keeps kicking.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> He?! Why do you think it's a boy?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> (laughs) My motherly intuition.</sp>

<sd>She puts his hand on her belly.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.</sp>

<sd>They laugh.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> I heard about your appointment. <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. I'm so proud of you.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I may be on the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name> . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (suspicious) What do you mean?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a <name type="NORP">Separatist</name>!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, <name type="PERSON">Padme</name>. Make a motion in the <name type="LOC">Senate</name>, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> What is it?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Nothing.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.</sp>

<sd>They look in each other's eyes.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.</sp>

<sd>PADME is startled at this.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> I sense there are things you are not telling me.</sp>

<sd>PADME smiles. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> is a little embarrassed.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on <name type="LOC">Naboo</name>, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.</sp>

<name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> runs up the stairs at the <name type="ORG">Galaxies Opera House</name>.
<name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> runs through the hallway and enters <name type="PERSON">Palpatine</name>'s box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with <name type="PERSON">Mas Amedda</name> and Sly-Moore, watching <name type="ORG">the Man Calamari Ballet</name> doing "Squid Lake."</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> You wanted to see me, Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Yes, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>. He is hiding in the <name type="LOC">Utapau</name> system.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I would worry about the collective wisdom of the <name type="ORG">Council</name> if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far � but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> They try.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> sits next to <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name>. The Chancellor leans over to him.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> (continuing) <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, you know I'm not able to rely on <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Council</name>. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I'm not sure I understand.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Council</name> want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I don't think . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, search your feelings. You know, don't you?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I know they don't trust you . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Or the <name type="LOC">Senate</name> . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I don't know ... I don't know what to say.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Remember back to your early teachings. <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> use their power for good.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Good is a point of view, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. And <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> point of view is not the only valid one. The <name type="PERSON">Dark Lord</name>s of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> to be. . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> . . . evil.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>. That is why they are more powerful.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> And <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> don't?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> are selfless . . . they only care about others.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> smiles.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I'm not sure it's wrong.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Have they asked you to betray <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> and the Sith.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> is deep in thought.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> No.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I thought not. It's not a story <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a <name type="PERSON">Dark Lord</name> of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the <name type="ORG">Force</name> to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> He could actually save people from death?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> The dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name> is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> What happened to him?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Is it possible to learn this power?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Not from a Jedi.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> Act on this, we must. The capture of <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name> will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> (a little peeved) The <name type="ORG">Council</name> will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="GPE">KI</name>-ADI-MUNDI</speaker> Yes, this decision is ours to make.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> A Master is needed, with more experience.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master <name type="PERSON">Kenobi</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> throws <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> a dirty look.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> Obi-Wan, my choice is.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="GPE">KI</name>-ADI-MUNDI</speaker> I concur. Master <name type="PERSON">Kenobi</name> should go.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> I agree.</sp>

<sd>All the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> concur.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Has <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name> been to see you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Council</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.</sp>

<sd>They laugh.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> You should be a Jedi, <name type="PERSON">Padme</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> You're not very good at hiding your feelings.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> It's <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name> . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Why would he talk to me about his work?</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> studies her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> Don't give me that look.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> I know how he feels about you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> (nervous) What did he say?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> Nothing. He didn't have to.</sp>

<sd>PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> I don't know what you're talking about.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. <name type="PERSON">Padme</name>, I'm worried about him.</sp>

<sd>PADME looks down and doesn't answer.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> We cannot let this turn into another war.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> <name type="PERSON">ORGANA</name></speaker> Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MON</name> MOTHMA</speaker> We are hoping to form an alliance in the <name type="LOC">Senate</name> to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BANA BREEMU</name></speaker> That would be dangerous.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MON</name> MOTHMA</speaker> We don't know where <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> stand in all this.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GIDDEAN DA<name type="ORG">NU</name></name></speaker> Going against the Chancellor without the support of <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> is risky.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">CHI EEKWAY</name></speaker> Patience, <name type="PERSON">Senator</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>FANG ZAR</speaker> We have so many <name type="PERSON">Senator</name>s on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name></speaker> You are strong and wise, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember.

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I understand your reservations completely, <name type="PERSON">Senator</name>, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the <name type="LOC">Senate</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> You must trust me to do the right things, <name type="PERSON">Senator</name>. That is why I am here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>FANG ZAR</speaker> But surely . . .</sp>

<sd>The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker> On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I thank you for bringing this to my attention, <name type="PERSON">Senator</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> That could be a dangerous move ... <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Council</name> would have to take control of the <name type="LOC">Senate</name> in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> We can only hope that Master <name type="PERSON">Kenobi</name> is up to the challenge.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I should be there with him.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> It is upsetting to me to see that the <name type="ORG">Council</name> doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the <name type="ORG">Council</name>. I know there are things about the <name type="ORG">Force</name> that they are not telling me.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> They don't trust you, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, you must break through the fog of lies <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>.</sp>

<sd>They walk into the hallway.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> How do you know the ways of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> My mentor taught me everything about the <name type="ORG">Force</name> . . . even the nature of the dark side.</sp>

<sd>They stop.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> You know the dark side?!?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>. Be careful of <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I won't be a pawn in your political game. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> are my family.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I would certainly like to.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I am going to turn you over to <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Council</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> arrives with THREE <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> to arrest <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Master Windu. I take it <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name> has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> In the name of the <name type="NORP">Galactic</name> <name type="LOC">Senate</name> of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU and the other <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> ignite their lightsabers.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> The <name type="LOC">Senate</name> will decide your fate.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> (burst of anger) I am the <name type="LOC">Senate</name>!</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> Not yet!</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> It's treason, then.</sp>

<sd>A close shot of <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> getting cut down by <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name>. <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> and <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> continue to fight.</sd>

<sd>Jedi Master <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> is able to use the <name type="ORG">Force</name> to slam <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.</sd>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor's office.</sd>

<sd>In the heat of battle, <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> cuts the window behind the Chancellor's desk, and it crashes away. <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> arrives to see <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> and <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> fighting.</sd>

<sd>They stop as <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> forces <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> to drop his sword. <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> and <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> start yelling at each other.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> You are under arrest, My Lord.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>! I told you it would come to this. I was right. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> are taking over.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> No! No! You will die!</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by <name type="PERSON">MACE</name>'s lightsaber. <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> is pushed back against the window sill.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> He is a traitor, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> He's the traitor. Stop him!</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Come to your senses, boy. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> You are not one of them, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. Don't let him kill me.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> Don't listen to him, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> pushes <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> out to the edge of the ledge. As <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> moves closer, the bolts from <name type="PERSON">Palpatine</name>'s hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> WINDU</speaker> He has too much control of the <name type="LOC">Senate</name> and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> It is not <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> way . . .</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">MACE</name> raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> (continuing) He must live . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Please don't, please don't . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I need him . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Please don't . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> NO!!!</sp>

<sd>Just as <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> is about to slash <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name>, <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> steps in and cuts off <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name>'s hand holding the lightsaber.</sd>

<sd>As <name type="PERSON">MACE</name> stares at <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> in shock, <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> springs to life.
The full force of <name type="PERSON">Palpatine</name>'s powerful Bolts blasts <name type="PERSON">MACE</name>. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> lowers his arm.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Power! Unlimited power!</sp>

<sd>His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. <name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> looks on in horror. <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name> cackles.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> What have I done?</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> sits.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> You are fulfilling your destin, <name type="PERSON">Anakin</name>. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I will do whatever you ask.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> Just help me save <name type="PERSON">Padme</name>'s life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.</sp>

<sd><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name> kneels before <name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Because the <name type="ORG">Council</name> did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot.

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I agree. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name>'s next move will be against the <name type="LOC">Senate</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> I understand, Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> We must move quickly. <name type="ORG">The Jedi</name> are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to <name type="FAC">the Jedi</name> <name type="LOC">Temple</name>. We will catch them off balance.

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N</name></speaker> What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="PERSON">PALPATINE</name></speaker> Their betrayal will be dealt with.

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE <name type="PERSON">SEEK</name>ER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing.

<sd>The <name type="ORG">NOS</name> <name type="ORG">MON</name>STER'S lunge takes him past OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, out of the cave, and into the water.</sd>

<sd>The SECOND <name type="PERSON">SEEK</name>ER shines its light on the <name type="ORG">NOS</name> <name type="ORG">MON</name>STER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE.

<sp><speaker>AT-ST CLONE <name type="ORG">SERGEANT</name></speaker> Everyone out of there!</sp>

<sd>A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CREATURE</speaker> Right you are, <name type="PERSON">Chewbacca</name>. Faster that will be.</sp>

<sd>YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. <name type="ORG">TARFFUL</name> climbs onto the AT-ST with <name type="ORG">CHEWBACCA</name>. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.</sd>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker> (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .</sp>

<sd>YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOO<name type="GPE">KI</name>EES follow on the AT-ST. The <name type="ORG">CLONES</name> continue to search the swamp.</sd>
