This separatist movement <verb lemma="have">has</verb>

difficult for the limited number of
Jedi Kights to maintain peace and

Senator Amidala, the former Queen of

      <sd>The ships <verb lemma="skim">skim</verb> across the surface of the city landscape. The sun <verb lemma="glint">glints</verb> off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.</sd>

      <sd>Two Naboo Fighters <verb lemma="land">land</verb> on one leaf of a three-leaf-clover landing platform. The Royal Starship lands on the central lead, and the third Fighter lands on the remaining plaform.</sd>
      <sd>A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well <verb lemma="dress">dressed</verb> JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaid<verb lemma="en">en</verb>.</sd>
      <sd>One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> and removes his helmet. He <verb lemma="be">is</verb> CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR PADME'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.</sd>

      <sd>Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS <verb lemma="get">get</verb> up and <verb lemma="run">run</verb> to where SENATOR PADME lies dying.

				(continued)
			This grievous <verb lemma="blow">blow</verb>
         <verb lemma="be">is</verb> especially
			personal to me. Before I became
			Chancellor, I served Amidala when
			she <verb lemma="be">was</verb> Queen. She <verb lemma="be">was</verb> a great
			leader who <verb lemma="fight">fought</verb> for justice, not
			only in this honourable assembly,
			but also on her home planet. She
			<verb lemma="be">was</verb> so loved she could <verb lemma="have">have</verb> been
			elected queen for life. She
			believed in public service, and
			she fervently believed in
			democracy. Her death <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a great
			loss to us all. We will all <verb lemma="mourn">mourn</verb>
			her as a relentless champion of
			freedom... and as a dear friend.</sp>
      <sd>There <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a moment of silence. ASK AAK, the SENATOR of MALASTARE, moves his pod into the centre of the arena.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>SENATOR ASK AAK</speaker>
			How many more Senators will <verb lemma="die">die</verb>
			before this civil strife ends! We

			and they <verb lemma="need">need</verb> an army to <verb lemma="do">do</verb> it.</sp>
      <sd>A second pod moves into the centre of the area with DARSANA, the 
AMBASSADOR OF GLEE ANSELM.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>AMBASSADOR DARSANA</speaker>
			Why weren't the Jedi able to <verb lemma="stop">stop</verb>

      <sd>Senator ORN FREE TAA swings forward in his pod.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>ORN FREE TAA</speaker>
			The Republic needs more security

      <sp>
         <speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
			Must I remind the Senator from
			Malast<verb lemma="be">are</verb> that negotiations <verb lemma="be">are</verb>
         <verb lemma="continue">continuing</verb> with the separatists.

         <speaker>PADME</speaker>
			 	(continuing)

         <verb lemma="wake">Wake</verb> up, Senators... you must <verb lemma="wake">wake</verb>
			up! If you <verb lemma="offer">offer</verb> the separatists
			violence, they can only <verb lemma="show">show</verb> us
			violence in return! Many will
			<verb lemma="lose">lose</verb> their lives. All will <verb lemma="lose">lose</verb>

         <verb lemma="fear">fear</verb>

      <sd>There <verb lemma="be">is</verb> an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to PADME.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>ORN FREE TAA</speaker>
			My motion to <verb lemma="defer">defer</verb> the <verb lemma="vote">vote</verb> must

      <sd>PADME looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.</sd>
      <sp>
         <speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
			Due to the lateness of the hour

				(continuing)
			<verb lemma="excuse">Excuse</verb> me for a moment.</sp>
      <sd>ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zam�s speeder about five stories below them <verb lemma="cruise">cruising</verb> past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunter�s speeder. The speeder <verb lemma="wobble">wobbles</verb> under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what <verb lemma="have">has</verb> happened.</sd>
      <sd>ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the <verb lemma="back">back</verb> strut and almost slips off, but <verb lemma="manage">manages</verb> to <verb lemma="hang">hang</verb> on. ANAKIN works his way <verb lemma="back">back</verb> to the speeder�s cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN <verb lemma="fly">flies</verb> forward to the <verb lemma="leave">left</verb>
         <verb lemma="front">front</verb> fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM can�t <verb lemma="reach">reach</verb> him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.</sd>
      <sd>OBI-WAN <verb lemma="have">has</verb> jumped into the driver�s seat of his speeder and <verb lemma="be">is</verb> deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders <verb lemma="dive">dive</verb> through oncoming traffic and then through <verb lemma="cross">cross</verb> traffic. Finally, ANAKIN <verb lemma="be">is</verb> able to <verb lemma="get">get</verb>
         <verb lemma="hold">hold</verb> of his lightsaber and starts to <verb lemma="cut">cut</verb> his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts <verb lemma="fire">firing</verb> at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passenger�s seat.</sd>
      <sd>ANAKIN sticks his <verb lemma="hand">hand</verb> into the cockpit and, <verb lemma="use">using</verb> the Force, pulls the <verb lemma="gun">gun</verb> out of ZAM�S hand. She grabs the Jedi�s hand, and they <verb lemma="struggle">struggle</verb> for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to <verb lemma="pull">pull</verb> the speeder out of it�s nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunter�s speeder.</sd>
      <sd>Just as the dragster <verb lemma="be">is</verb> about to nose <verb lemma="dive">dive</verb> into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street.</sd>
      <setting>EXT. ENTERTAINMENT STREET - NIGHT</setting>
      <sd>ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.</sd>
      <sd>It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.</sd>
      <sd>ANAKIN <verb lemma="barge">barges</verb> into several of them as he <verb lemma="chase">chase</verb>s after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi <verb lemma="be">is</verb>
         <verb lemma="have">having</verb> a very difficult time getting through the crowd.</sd>
      <sd>Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.</sd>
      <sd>A nightclub <verb lemma="sigh">sighs</verb>
         <verb lemma="be">is</verb> flashing over the door. ANAKIN <verb lemma="be">is</verb> just about to <verb lemma="follow">follow</verb> ZAM when there <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE <verb lemma="start">start</verb>
         <verb lemma="move">moving</verb> out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber.</sd>

      <sd>Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the <verb lemma="rage">raging</verb> ocean.

      <sd>OBI-WAN ducks around the post as the ACKLAY charges. It knocks the post flat, sending OBI-WAN sprawling.
