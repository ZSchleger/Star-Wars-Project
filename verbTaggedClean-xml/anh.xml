 <crawl> A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

  It <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships, 
  <verb lemma="strike">striking</verb> from a hidden base, <verb lemma="have">have</verb> <verb lemma="win">won</verb> their first 
  victory against the evil Galactic Empire.

  During the battle, Rebel <verb lemma="spy">spies</verb> managed to <verb lemma="steal">steal</verb> 
  secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the 
  Death Star, an armored space <verb lemma="station">station</verb> with enough 
  power to <verb lemma="destroy">destroy</verb> an entire planet.

  <verb lemma="pursue">Pursued</verb> by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess 
  Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of 
  the stolen plans that can <verb lemma="save">save</verb> her people and 
  restore freedom to the galaxy...</crawl>

<sd>The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total 
eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny 
silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner <verb lemma="fire">firing</verb> <verb lemma="laser">lasers</verb> 
from the <verb lemma="back">back</verb> of the ship, races through space. It <verb lemma="be">is</verb> <verb lemma="purse">pursed</verb> 
by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly 
laserbolts <verb lemma="streak">streak</verb> from the Imperial Stardestroyer, <verb lemma="cause">causing</verb> 
the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.</sd>

<sd>An explosion rocks the <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) <verb lemma="struggle">struggle</verb> to <verb lemma="make">make</verb> their way 
through the shaking, <verb lemma="bounce">bouncing</verb> passageway. Both robots <verb lemma="be">are</verb> 
old and battered. Artoo <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a short, claw-armed tripod. His 
<verb lemma="face">face</verb> <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. 
Threepio, on the other hand, <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a tall, slender robot of 
human proportions. He <verb lemma="have">has</verb> a <verb lemma="gleam">gleaming</verb> bronze-like metallic 
surface of an Art Deco design.</sd>

<sd>Another <verb lemma="blast">blast</verb> shakes them as they <verb lemma="struggle">struggle</verb> along their way.</sd>

<sd>A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. 
The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone 
figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations 
who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy 
hair and baggy tunic <verb lemma="give">give</verb> him the air of a simple but lovable 
lad with a prize-winning smile.</sd>

<sd>A <verb lemma="light">light</verb> wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a 
large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the 
desert floor much <verb lemma="like">like</verb> an oil pipe with valves. He <verb lemma="be">is</verb> aided 
by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot 
appears to <verb lemma="be">be</verb> barely <verb lemma="function">functioning</verb> and moves with jerky motions.  
A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's <verb lemma="eye">eye</verb> and 
he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his 
utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying 
the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repai<verb lemma="red">red</verb> 
Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet

<sd>The robot <verb lemma="scoot">scoots</verb> around in a tight circle, stops short, and

Darth Vader, right <verb lemma="hand">hand</verb> of the Emperor. His <verb lemma="face">face</verb> <verb lemma="be">is</verb> obscured 
by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which 
stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the 
Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away 
from the <verb lemma="impose">imposing</verb> warrior and a deathly <verb lemma="quiet">quiet</verb> sweeps through

<sd>A familiar clanking <verb lemma="sound">sound</verb> attacks Threepio's attention and 
he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years 
old) stands in <verb lemma="front">front</verb> of Artoo. Surreal and out of place, 
dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting 
something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little 
robot joins his companion.</sd>

slams a wrench across the workbench.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs <verb lemma="be">is</verb> 
right. I'm never gonna <verb lemma="get">get</verb> out of

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Is there anything I might <verb lemma="do">do</verb> to help?</sp>

<sd>Luke <verb lemma="glance">glances</verb> at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Well, not unless you can <verb lemma="alter">alter</verb> time,

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I don't think so, sir. I'm only a

Uh, you can <verb lemma="call">call</verb> me Luke.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>

Just Luke.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg 
relations, and this <verb lemma="be">is</verb> my counterpart, 
Artoo-Detoo.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Hello.</sp>

<sd>Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to 
<verb lemma="scrape">scrape</verb> several connectors on the robot's <verb lemma="head">head</verb> with a chrome 
pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins <verb lemma="wipe">wiping</verb> 
oil from his bronze body.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You got a lot of carbon scoring here. 
It looks <verb lemma="like">like</verb> you boys <verb lemma="have">have</verb> seen a 
lot of action.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
With all we've been through, sometimes 
I'm amazed we're in as good condition 
as we are, what with the Rebellion 
and all.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You <verb lemma="know">know</verb> of the Rebellion against 
the Empire?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
That's how we <verb lemma="come">came</verb> to <verb lemma="be">be</verb> in your

sir.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
<verb lemma="have">Have</verb> you been in many battles?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Several, I think. Actually, there's 
not much to tell. I'm not much more 
than an interpreter, and not very 
good at telling stories. Well, not 
at <verb lemma="make">making</verb> them interesting, anyways.</sp>

<sd>Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's 
neck joint. He uses a larger pick.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Well, my little friend, you've got 
something jammed in here real good. 
Were you on a cruiser or...</sp>

<sd>The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke <verb lemma="tumble">tumbling</verb> 
<verb lemma="head">head</verb> over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch three-
dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator, being 
<verb lemma="project">projected</verb> from the <verb lemma="face">face</verb> of little Artoo. The image <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a 
rain<verb lemma="bow">bow</verb> of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
<verb lemma="help">Help</verb> me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my 
only hope.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
What's this?</sp>

<sd>Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an <verb lemma="answer">answer</verb> for Threepio 
to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence fragment 
over and over.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
What <verb lemma="be">is</verb> what?!? He asked you a 
question...
(pointing to Leia)
What <verb lemma="be">is</verb> that?</sp>

<sd>Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just <verb lemma="notice">notice</verb> 
the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an <verb lemma="answer">answer</verb>

You're my only hope.</sp>

Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely 
a malfunction. Old data. <verb lemma="pay">Pay</verb> it no

<sd>Luke becomes <verb lemma="intrigue">intrigued</verb> by the beautiful girl.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Who <verb lemma="be">is</verb> she? She's beautiful.</sp>

I'm <verb lemma="afraid">afraid</verb> I'm not quite sure, sir.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
<verb lemma="help">Help</verb> me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I think she <verb lemma="be">was</verb> a passenger on our

importance, sir -- I believe. Our 
captain <verb lemma="be">was</verb> attached to...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Is there more to this recording?</sp>

<sd>Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic 
<verb lemma="squeak">squeaks</verb> and a whistle.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going 
to <verb lemma="get">get</verb> us in trouble. It's all right, 
you can <verb lemma="trust">trust</verb> him. He's our new 
master.</sp>

<sd>Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
He says he's the property of Obi-Wan 
Kenobi, a resident of these parts. 
And it's a private message for him. 
Quite frankly, sir I don't <verb lemma="know">know</verb> what 
he's talking about. Our <verb lemma="last">last</verb> master 
<verb lemma="be">was</verb> Captain Antilles, but with what 
we've been through, this little R2 
unit <verb lemma="have">has</verb> become a bit eccentric.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means 
old Ben Kenobi?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I beg your pardon, sir, but <verb lemma="do">do</verb> you 
<verb lemma="know">know</verb> what he's talking about?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Well, I don't <verb lemma="know">know</verb> anyone named Obi-
Wan, but old Ben lives out beyond 
the dune sea. He's kind of a strange 
old hermit.</sp>

<sd>Luke's <verb lemma="gaze">gazes</verb> at the beautiful young princess for a few 
moments.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I wonder who she is. It sounds <verb lemma="like">like</verb> 
she's in trouble. I'd better play 
<verb lemma="back">back</verb> the whole thing.</sp>

<sd>Artoo beeps something to Threepio.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
He says the restraining bolt <verb lemma="have">has</verb> 
<verb lemma="short">short</verb> <verb lemma="circuit">circuited</verb> his recording system. 
He suggests that if you remove the 
bolt, he might <verb lemma="be">be</verb> able to play <verb lemma="back">back</verb> 
the entire recording.</sp>

<sd>Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and hasn't 
really heard what Threepio <verb lemma="have">has</verb> been saying.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I <verb lemma="guess">guess</verb> you're 
too small to <verb lemma="run">run</verb> away on me if I 
<verb lemma="take">take</verb> this off! Okay.</sp>

<sd>Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off 
Artoo's side.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
There you go.</sp>

<sd>The princess immediately disappears...</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? 
<verb lemma="bring">Bring</verb> her back! <verb lemma="play">Play</verb> <verb lemma="back">back</verb> the entire 
message.</sp>

<sd>Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in 
embarrassment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
What message? The one you're carrying 
inside your rusty innards!</sp>

<sd>A women's voice calls out from another room.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AUNT BERU</speaker>
Luke? Luke! <verb lemma="come">Come</verb> to dinner!</sp>

<sd>Luke stands up and shakes his <verb lemma="head">head</verb> at the malfunctioning

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
All right, I'll <verb lemma="be">be</verb> right there, Aunt 
Beru.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to

<sd>Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and 
<verb lemma="hurry">hurries</verb> out of the room.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Well, <verb lemma="see">see</verb> what you can <verb lemma="do">do</verb> with him.

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>

Just you reconsider playing that

<sd>Artoo beeps in response.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
No, I don't think he likes you at 
all.</sp>

<sd>Artoo beeps.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
No, I don't <verb lemma="like">like</verb> you either.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You know, I think that R2 unit we

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
What makes you think that?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Well, I stumbled across a recording

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking

<sp><speaker>OWEN</speaker>
He won't, I don't think he exists

Yes, sir. I think those new droids

<sd>Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a <verb lemma="rock">rock</verb> ridge and 
scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the 
two riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young 
adventurer.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
There <verb lemma="be">are</verb> two Banthas down there but 
I don't <verb lemma="see">see</verb> any... wait a second, 
they're Sandpeople all right. I can 
<verb lemma="see">see</verb> one of them now.</sp>

<sd>Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his 
electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in <verb lemma="front">front</verb> of 
his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large, 
gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio <verb lemma="be">is</verb> startled 
and backs away, right off the <verb lemma="side">side</verb> if the cliff. He can <verb lemma="be">be</verb> 
heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles 
down the <verb lemma="side">side</verb> of the mountain.</sd>

<sd>The towe<verb lemma="ring">ring</verb> creature brings down his curved, double-pointed 
gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that <verb lemma="have">has</verb> <verb lemma="strike">struck</verb> terror in 
the heart of the local settlers. But Luke manages to <verb lemma="block">block</verb> 
the <verb lemma="blow">blow</verb> with his laser rifle, which <verb lemma="be">is</verb> smashed to pieces. 
The <verb lemma="terrify">terrified</verb> farm boy scrambles backward until he <verb lemma="be">is</verb> forced 
to the <verb lemma="edge">edge</verb> of a deep crevice. The sinister Raider stands 
over him with his weapon raised and lets out a horrible

everything <verb lemma="be">is</verb> <verb lemma="quiet">quiet</verb> for a few moments. A great <verb lemma="howl">howling</verb> moan

<sd>Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight 
swishing <verb lemma="sound">sound</verb> that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even

I've never seen such devotion in a

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
No, my father didn't <verb lemma="fight">fight</verb> in the

<sd>Ben hands Luke the saber.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
What <verb lemma="be">is</verb> it?</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
Your fathers lightsaber. This <verb lemma="be">is</verb> the

or as random as a blaster.</sp>

<sd>Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out 
about four feet and flickers there. The <verb lemma="light">light</verb> plays across

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
An elegant weapon for a more civilized 
time. For over a thousand generations 
the Jedi Knights <verb lemma="be">were</verb> the guardians 
of peace and justice in the Old 
Republic. Before the dark times, 
before the Empire.</sp>

<sd>Luke hasn't really been listening.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
How <verb lemma="do">did</verb> my father die?</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who

Well, the Force <verb lemma="be">is</verb> what gives a Jedi

Han, my boy, there <verb lemma="be">are</verb> times when

poor Greedo <verb lemma="like">like</verb> that... after all 
we've been through together.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
You sent Greedo to <verb lemma="blast">blast</verb> me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
(mock surprise)
Han, why you're the best smuggler in 
the business. You're too valuable to 
fry. He <verb lemma="be">was</verb> only relaying my <verb lemma="concern">concern</verb> 
at your delays. He wasn't going to 
<verb lemma="blast">blast</verb> you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I think he <verb lemma="think">thought</verb> he was. Next time 
don't send one of those twerps. If 
you've got something to <verb lemma="say">say</verb> to me, 
<verb lemma="come">come</verb> <verb lemma="see">see</verb> me yourself.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
Han, Han! If only you hadn't <verb lemma="have">had</verb> to

understand I just can't <verb lemma="make">make</verb> an

their shipment at the first <verb lemma="sign">sign</verb> of

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
You know, even I <verb lemma="get">get</verb> boarded 
sometimes, Jabba. I <verb lemma="have">had</verb> no choice, 
but I've got a charter now and I can 
<verb lemma="pay">pay</verb> you back, plus a little extra. I

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
(to his men)
<verb lemma="put">Put</verb> your blasters away. Han, my boy, 
I'm only doing this because you're 
the best and I <verb lemma="need">need</verb> you. So, for an 
extra, <verb lemma="say">say</verb> twenty percent I'll <verb lemma="give">give</verb> 
you a little more time... but this
