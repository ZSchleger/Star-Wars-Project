STAR WARS
EPISODE VIII
THE LAST JEDI
THE GALAXY IS IN A STATE OF FLUX.
AFTER A COSTLY DEFEAT ON STARKILLER BASE, THE FIRST ORDER IS 
RETREATING RAPIDLY.
THE RESISTANCE, LED BY GENERAL LEIA ORGANA, HAS SUFFERED 
LOSSES, BUT CONTINUES TO PUT PRESSURE ON THEIR ENEMIES.
COMMANDER SNOKE PREPARES A NEW THREAT ALONGSIDE HIS WARRIOR 
KYLO REN, ON THE HUNT FOR RESISTANCE LEADERS.
LUKE SKYWALKER HAS BEEN FOUND ON AN UNDISCOVERABLE PLANET, 
AND IN HIS PATH LAYS THE FATE OF THE ENTIRE GALAXY.
The text flies away as we pan down to the IRISH PLANET seen 
at the end of The Force Awakens.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY
Back to that final shot from The Force Awakens, LUKE stares 
at REY, surprised and a little shocked at the LIGHTSABER in 
her hand.
Luke puts his mechanical hand out, Rey passes him the 
lightsaber.
Luke examines this machine, his old ally, one that carries 
memories fond and painful.
Rey watches this master reconnect with his blade.
Luke throws it off the cliffside and walks away.
REY
Wait. Wait.
Rey follows Luke.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - PATHWAY
Luke doesn’t break his stride.
REY
I’ve come all this way.
LUKE
So you know your way back.
REY
Everyone has been looking for you.
LUKE
Which is why I’ve kept myself 
hidden.
REY
Just... Wait one second.
Rey holds out her hand, a tree branch snaps off in front of 
Luke, almost hitting his face.
Luke stops. He turns around.
LUKE
No.
REY
Look...
Luke shakes his head.
LUKE
No.
Rey lifts some stones from the ground.
REY
It’s not much, but I have this 
power. I just... need to know how 
to use it.
LUKE
You don’t use the force, it uses 
you, and destroys everything you 
love.
Luke turns away and keeps walking. Rey watches, getting 
impatient.
REY
If you won’t help me, at least help 
your sister.
Luke almost slips as he walks, but carries on, away.
Rey waits a moment then continues to follow.
2.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - HALLWAY - DAY
General LEIA walks down a hallway as soldiers and pilots 
wander past, a hive of activity.
Behind her, C3PO judders along.
BASE TANNOY (O.S.)
All units report to briefing room 
immediately.
Leia seems lost amidst the chaos, she stops and stumbles in 
her walk, mirroring Luke.
C3PO grabs hold of her arm, she looks to the droid and nods. 
They keep going.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Leia and C3PO walk into a room full of soldiers sitting, 
standing, waiting.
Everyone sitting stands for General Leia.
POE sits amongst the pilots, he stands out because have you 
seen that guy?
Leia sits at a command console, there’s a seat next to her.
People look to Leia for leadership. She’s not there for that.
MYSTERY FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
Listen up soldiers, we’ve got some 
new intel coming in.
A figure storms into the room, we see bright pink hair and it 
is clearly LAURA DERN.
LAURA DERN
Put it on the screen.
The holo-screen in the centre of the room becomes a star 
formation with a few pings.
LAURA DERN (CONT’D)
Our scout droids have found seismic 
activity on a planet in the 
Letachoin system, only twenty 
parsecs from the remnants of 
Starkiller.
3.
Laura Dern sits down next to Leia, she gently touches Leia’s 
arm, Leia looks over to watch as Laura Dern presses some 
computing buttons.
The holo-screen focuses in on one planet, with clear red dots 
in the north-east.
LAURA DERN (CONT’D)
Of all the intel we’ve gathered 
this is likely to be the final 
battalion of the First Order.
Laura Dern stands and walks through the holo-screen in a cool 
visual.
LAURA DERN (CONT’D)
Load up every ship, at the end of 
this solar cycle we’ll have 
vanquished the first order from the 
bowels of history. Dismissed.
Troops stand and leave, Laura Dern sits next to Leia again, 
she looks over, Leia doesn’t.
Poe steps through the holo-screen as it expands out to the 
system.
POE
Excuse me, Admiral, the fleet 
hasn’t recovered from the 
Starkiller skirmish, I have friends 
in medbay still. It’s not wise to 
race out so quickly.
Laura Dern looks at Poe.
LAURA DERN
What’s your rank?
POE
Captain.
LAURA DERN
Well when you’re promoted to 
General, come back to me and give 
me your opinion.
(Beat)
Dismissed.
Poe looks to Leia. Nothing.
LAURA DERN (CONT’D)
Dismissed, captain.
4.
Poe salutes and walks away.
INT. RED ROOM
A blindingly red room, wide and long.
A door opens, revealing blackness. From the blackness walks 
KYLO, masked and caped, walking with purpose.
The door closes, Kylo is the only shot of black amidst the 
red.
He kneels.
Beyond, we see SNOKE sitting on a throne.
SNOKE
Ren, finally you make time for your 
master.
Kylo looks up, still kneeling.
KYLO
It’s been a busy time.
SNOKE
I know all about losing Starkiller, 
those at fault will be seen to, 
have no doubts. Stand, Ren.
Kylo gets back up, he approaches the throne.
SNOKE (CONT’D)
But you, I have a special operation 
for.
KYLO
Master?
SNOKE
The leaders of the resistance are 
showing their faces, overly 
confident in their victory. Hunt 
them down, use all your might, for 
the good of the order.
Kylo looks up at Snoke.
KYLO
Master, I found one on Starkiller, 
one whose power felt strong, whose 
potential could provide the order 
with strength beyond all.
5.
SNOKE
A Jedi?
KYLO
A sith, master, if we can get to 
her first.
Snoke shakes his head.
SNOKE
Bah, distractions to the cause, 
Ren. Focus on destroying the 
resistance, when we take the 
galaxy, then perhaps you can take 
an apprentice.
KYLO
Not an apprentice, Master, an 
equal.
SNOKE
When I found you I saw raw, untamed 
power. And beyond that, something 
truly special. You can lead one 
day, Ren. You can take the galaxy 
and rule. Do not let your talents 
go on hunting another.
Snoke stands, towering.
SNOKE (CONT’D)
Not when victory is so near.
Snoke floats towards Kylo.
SNOKE (CONT’D)
Clear your mind, find the leaders, 
crush the resistance.
Snoke is face-to-face with Kylo.
KYLO
Yes, master.
Kylo turns and walks away.
EXT. FALLEN TEMPLE - NIGHT
Kylo exits an old temple, pillars fallen and standing charred 
to bits.
He takes out his lightsaber and slashes a pillar by him, it 
collapses as he walks away.
6.
In the beyond, in front of Kylo, a starship sits, with a 
squad of STORMTROOPERS standing to attention.
Kylo walks towards them.
KYLO
Shape up and ship out, we’re headed 
to ACTOS TWELVE on the double.
The troopers form up around Kylo and walk up onto the ship.
It hovers and then shoots off into the night sky, a bright 
flash becoming just another star.
INT. MED BAY - DAY
A row of beds full of soldiers.
Poe wanders down them, to the near-end where FINN lays, 
asleep.
A DROID NURSE slides and whistles over, Poe gives a wink.
POE
Nurse, give this man as much relief 
as possible, we’re taking his leg 
today.
The Droid Nurse whistles a few times and shakes its nozzle or 
whatever it has.
FINN
(Dazed)
I’ll keep all my bits thank you.
Poe smiles and pats Finn on the hand.
POE
Morning sunshine. How you healing?
Finn looks at Poe.
FINN
I’m about ready to give the first 
order another hit.
POE
Well we’re about to ship up, so 
come with us.
Finn almost sits up, the Droid Nurse whistles over and sears 
his back-wound, Finn sucks his teeth and falls back to the 
bed.
7.
FINN
Gimme a minute.
POE
Nice try. I’ll come back and see 
you but good.
FINN
No, hold on, I can do it, just 
close your eyes, it’s a lot of 
pressure.
Poe closes his eyes.
Finn stays laying down.
FINN (CONT’D)
There, I got up, but then went 
straight back down, you missed it.
Poe smiles as he opens his eyes.
POE
Your bravery will be heard across 
the galaxy. I’ll make sure you get 
a memorial holostatue somewhere 
fancy.
FINN
You best believe it.
POE
Look, if you do fancy a trip to the 
first order’s last stand, we’re 
flying here.
Poe grabs a space-tissue and etches with some sort of spacepen, he hands this to Finn.
POE (CONT’D)
We can use all the blaster fodder 
we can get.
FINN
You’ll make an inspiring leader.
Poe and Finn smile as Poe heads away from the bed.
FINN (CONT’D)
Hey Dameron.
Poe turns around.
8.
FINN (CONT’D)
Bring the fury of the resistance.
Poe clutches his fist in the air, it’s a cool-as-heck moment, 
something kids will do in school, and in twenty years will 
become a cultural moment used in other films because so many 
kids who grew up loving it now only make films based on this 
moment, and have no creativity themselves. But for now, in 
the moment of innocence, before hind-sight, it’s baller.
OPTICAL WIPE TO:
EXT. STAR DESTROYER - SPACE NIGHT
A large First Order star destroyer floats on amongst the 
stars. Ships dock with it and leave on missions. It is a hive 
of activity.
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE
DOMHNALL Gleeson stands at the windows of the bridge looking 
out upon the galaxy he seeks to own.
Various suited and helmeted soldiers, officers and tech folk 
stand below and next to him pressing buttons, looking busy.
PROGSPOCTOR VERGEN (O.S.)
Sir, Kylo Ren has boarded.
Domhnall turns to a normal-looking uniformed person, known to 
all ComicCon attendees as PROGSPOCTOR VERGEN.
DOMHNALL
Great, maybe he can help blow up 
another station whilst we make a 
move.
PROGSPOCTOR VERGEN
Sir?
DOMHNALL
I’m venting, don’t tell him I said 
anything.
FRENDERSLUDGE GASSYUNTH (O.S.)
General Domhnall, sir, Master Snoke 
is sending a transmission.
Domhnall turns to a Rodian in a sleek Black First Order 
commander uniform, this guy out of make up will sign 
headshots of his character FRENDERSLUDGE GASSYUNTH for the 
next 30-40 years.
9.
DOMHNALL
I’ll take it in private chambers.
FRENDERSLUDGE GASSYUNTH
Patching through.
Domhnall walks through the bridge, folk salute him as he does 
so.
INT. STAR DESTROYER DOMHNALL’S RESIDENCE
A door slides open and Domhnall walks in to a dark room, with 
a few shelves of guns and a First Order banner on the wall.
In the middle of the room, Snoke appears large and in blue.
SNOKE
General.
DOMHNALL
Master Snoke, I trust you’re well.
SNOKE
Were you ever intending to inform 
me of Starkiller?
Domhnall nods his head.
DOMHNALL
Of course, sir, an oversight by 
myself, I’ve been arranging new 
accommodation for the order, away 
from resistance eyes.
SNOKE
Bah. The first order needs to 
change its tactics if you wish to 
win the war.
DOMHNALL
In what way?
SNOKE
Mobility, General, is what’s 
required. We can no-longer focus on 
megaweapons, but if we keep a fleet 
free from planets, from any orbits, 
we can strike anywhere, anytime.
DOMHNALL
I’m not sure we have the facilities 
for that.
10.
SNOKE
(Loudly)
Then Make Changes!
Domhnall gasps for air and clutches his throat. He lets go 
and falls to the ground a little.
DOMHNALL
Yes sir. Change agreed, sir.
SNOKE
Excellent. Do not fail me again 
General. The First Order must fight 
on.
The transmission stops, the room goes completely black, 
before a light flashes on and Domhnall stands up, dusts 
himself off, and gives a head-butt motion to the area Snoke 
just was.
Domhnall goes to walk out of the room, the door opens.
Kylo is standing before him.
DOMHNALL
Master Ren.
KYLO
General. You look well.
DOMHNALL
What can I do for you?
Domhnall walks out of the room, the door slides down.
INT. STAR DESTROYER HALLWAY
Kylo and Domhnall walk and talk as First Order units walk the 
other way, some salute.
KYLO
I require an additional squadron.
DOMHNALL
Do I get anything in return?
KYLO
Your life spared.
DOMHNALL
I’m starting to think it’s not 
worth all the trouble.
11.
KYLO
Then I can kill you where you 
stand.
Domhnall stops, Kylo stops alongside him.
Domhnall stares at Kylo for a beat.
He sighs, they keep walking.
DOMHNALL
Take your soldiers, Ren.
KYLO
Excellent decision, General.
Kylo walks off ahead of Domhnall. Domhnall picks a hair out 
of the back of his neck in anger.
DOMHNALL
I bloody hate the sith.
INT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE’S SHACK - EVENING
Luke sits in the dark, a fruit sits in a shimmer of light in 
front of him. He could force it to his hand.
Luke stares at the fruit. Then gets up and grabs it, biting 
into the peel.
REY (O.S.)
I can wait as long as you, you’re 
going to have to come out 
eventually.
Luke rolls his eyes.
REY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
You don’t think I’d come all this 
way and turn tail at the first 
step?
LUKE
You don’t know the half of what you 
think you want to know. And what 
you do is most troubling.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK
Rey leans on the side of a stone wall. Next to a light wooden 
door.
12.
REY
And what is it you think I know?
There’s a pause.
The door opens. Luke looks out.
LUKE
You want to use a weapon to hurt, 
to kill, because you believe power 
and strength will bring peace to 
the galaxy.
(Beat)
When you attack, you only create an 
enemy to fight.
REY
And when you run, you lose 
everything and everyone.
LUKE
If you think I ran then you don’t 
understand anything.
Luke goes back in, closing the door.
REY
Then make me.
INT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK
Luke sighs and looks over to the half-eaten fruit.
It shakes and starts to rise, heading towards Luke.
He snatches it in mid-air.
CRUNCH.
Another bite.
In the darkness a blue light appears.
Luke looks over.
LUKE
No.
The light forms into YODA, as he was in his ripe old last 
days.
Standing in the middle of the shack.
13.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Master Yoda?
Yoda looks to Luke.
YODA
Back in touch with the force I see, 
Luke.
LUKE
This shouldn’t be. You can’t be 
here.
Yoda chuckles.
YODA
Everything that cannot be is only 
in the mind of those that cannot 
see. You blinded yourself long 
enough Luke, have you gained any 
wisdom?
Luke shakes his head.
LUKE
I wasn’t searching for wisdom 
Master Yoda.
YODA
Looking for hope were you? But it 
appears to have found you first.
Luke kneels before Yoda’s vision.
LUKE
The girl? No.
YODA
You sense it too. There is power in 
her.
LUKE
What good does that do? Look at 
what happened before.
YODA
Power and compassion, Luke. The 
kind I once felt within you.
LUKE
I’m nothing like her.
14.
YODA
The fruit that falls to the ground 
decays, the fruit that rolls down 
the hill feeds a village.
Luke throws the rest of his fruit across the shack.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK
Rey leans on the wall.
The door bursts open and Luke walks out.
LUKE
Get some rest, your training begins 
at first light.
Luke walks away from his shack.
Rey punches the air.
Luke turns around.
Rey slowly drops her fist.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - EVENING
On the runways and hangers of the Resistance base we see 
troops rushing to ships, droids and mechanics giving final 
touches, and in the sky a large ship blocks out the sun for a 
moment as it flies off.
Poe and BB8 rush along towards an X-Wing sitting in 
residence.
BB8
Whistle whistle spurt whistle.
POE
I know, BB, but orders are orders.
Poe reaches the X-Wing and pushes a side button, the droid 
lift drops to the ground.
POE (CONT’D)
Get on.
BB8
Whistle spurt whistle.
BB8 shakes its head simultaneously.
15.
POE
You’re not leaving me alone.
BB8
Whistle.
Poe grabs BB8 and tries to push the droid onto the lift.
POE
I’m sorry buddy.
BB8 opens a compartment and cattle-prods Poe.
POE (CONT’D)
Ow.
BB8
Whistle spurt spurt.
POE
Fine. Stay. I’ll just die in space. 
Some pal you are.
BB8 begins to roll away.
Poe puts his helmet on and presses the lift to rise.
BB8 stops and rolls its head.
BB8 turns back and rolls to Poe.
BB8
Whistle whistle.
Poe smiles.
POE
There’s my buddy.
Poe hits the X-Wing with a Fonzie-like tap and the lift 
drops.
INT. POE’S X-WING COCKPIT
Poe sits in the cockpit, he straps in and pushes some 
buttons.
BB8
Squeal whistle spurt!
POE
Systems activated, We’re good to go 
bud.
16.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE
Poe’s X-Wing begins to rumble and move.
Other ships fly off in the background, as Poe and BB8 lift up 
and start flying off.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Laura Dern sits at the tactical ops table as green dots on a 
screen in front begin to pop up.
Some techsperts run around with data.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - LANDING SITE - NIGHT
CHEWBACCA and R2D2 seem to be in the middle of a pushing 
contest as Rey walks down the hillside to them and the 
MILLENIUM FALCON.
Chewbacca stops and looks over.
CHEWBACCA
Raaawr?
R2D2 pushes Chewbacca one last time, Chewbacca turns and 
swipes the metal beast onto its back.
R2D2
Beeep! Whistle woah.
REY
Easy you too.
CHEWBACCA
Rawwwr.
REY
Maybe he did, but still no need to 
hit that hard.
Rey helps R2D2 to their wheels.
CHEWBACCA
Raaaaaaaaaaawr?
Rey shakes her head.
REY
He’s stubborn, he’s not heading 
back anytime soon.
17.
Chewbacca hangs his head. Rey strokes Chewbacca’s arm.
REY (CONT’D)
But I have a plan.
Chewbacca looks over to Rey.
REY (CONT’D)
I’ve convinced him to train me a 
little. It’s a start. A long game.
R2D2 shakes its body.
REY (CONT’D)
I know, this is an immovable 
object. I just need to counter 
that, somehow.
Rey looks to Chewbacca.
REY (CONT’D)
I’m going to be here for a while. 
I’d suggest the two of you head 
back, look after General Organa. 
She needs you more.
CHEWBACCA
Raaawr, awwwwr!
Rey nods.
REY
I’ll find my own way back, 
Skywalker couldn’t have gotten here 
without a ship.
R2D2
Whistle beep beep.
CHEWBACCA
Raaawr.
REY
Maybe so, but the General is the 
highest priority right now.
Chewbacca embraces Rey.
CHEWBACCA
Raaaaawr!
REY
Thanks Chewie, you too.
18.
Chewbacca heads up the pathway and into the ship.
Rey looks to R2D2.
REY (CONT’D)
Go on Artoo.
R2D2
Beep beep, whistle.
Rey smiles.
REY
Are you sure, it’s going to be a 
long time here.
R2D2
Whistle whistle beep.
Rey nods.
REY
Well, if you insist.
The ramp to the Falcon lifts.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Chewbacca sits down at the co-pilot seat, looks around and 
shakes his head.
Chewbacca stands and looks to the pilot chair. He wipes a 
tear from his eye, sighs and sits.
He presses some buttons.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - LANDING SITE
The Falcon lifts up as Rey and R2D2 watch.
It flies into space.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Chewbacca steers the wheel high and out of orbit he goes.
A PORG pounces onto the chair beside him.
Chewbacca looks at the creature, it stares back, blinks, then 
leaps to the dashboard.
19.
CHEWBACCA
Raaaawr!
The Porg throws out a weird alien scream.
Chewbacca punches the Falcon and heads into hyperspace.
INT. MED BAY
Finn lays in bed as a few troops hug people in beds and head 
off, putting helmets on. It’s all action here.
Finn looks around and reaches for a data pole.
FINN
Come on, you can do this.
Finn grabs hold of the pole and begins to move towards it.
His legs swing off the edge of the bed.
Finn winces in pain.
One foot dangles close to the floor.
Finn shimmies off the bed a little.
His feet touch ground.
His legs begin to straighten up.
Finn lifts himself off the bed, holding on to the pole.
He leans too hard and begins to topple, then leans backwards, 
never finding footing.
FINN (CONT’D)
Woah.
A third lean in the centre and Finn finds ground.
FINN (CONT’D)
Aaah.
Finn clutches at his back, there’s a large white medical 
sleeve on it.
He removes it, there’s a scar on his spine but nothing else.
Finn throws the sleeve and begins to walk, a bit like a baby.
Finn walks the med bay, passing other soldiers.
20.
He charmingly nods and smiles.
FINN (CONT’D)
Hey, what’s up?
They wave back.
Before him there’s one bed surrounded by a curtain.
Finn walks past.
A VOICE (O.S.)
Wait, now? You gotta get outta
there. Immediately.
Finn stops, he leans in.
A VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Because they are bad news, always.
Finn’s legs give out and he stumbles through the curtain, 
landing on the bed, in front of a girl.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG stands with a holocommunicator showing a pretty young woman on the other end, 
in a glossy and sequined costume.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks over to Finn, 
who looks up to Finn.
Finn smiles.
FINN
Hey there, how’s things?
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang quickly shuts off the 
communicator and stares at Finn.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
How much of that did you hear?
FINN
How much did you want me to hear?
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang shakes her head.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
I’m not playing games.
FINN
That’s a shame, I’m great at cards.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
You should get out of here.
21.
FINN
I’ve not had a good run of escaping 
places, it always leads to more 
trouble.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Very well.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang heads to leave through 
the curtains. She stops. Turns back, red eyes.
FINN
Woah, hey, what’s wrong?
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks at Finn.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Can you keep a secret?
FINN
Not at all, tell me.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
My sister called from Expraxis, 
there’s a First Order juggernaut 
orbiting the planet right now.
Finn sits up, he clutches his back immediately after.
FINN
A destroyer?
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang nods.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Only one.
FINN
Laura Dern’s sending all our fleet 
to a location already, if the First 
Order are going to outer rim places 
like Expraxis then this could be 
their next step. We have to warn 
someone.
Finn gets up, he holds out his hand to Kelly Marie Tran From 
Comedy Bang Bang.
FINN (CONT’D)
Come on.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang grabs Finn’s hand and 
they rush out of the ward.
22.
EXT. SPACE
A large Resistance-engraved ship flies away from a planet, XWings and Y-Wings surround it.
Poe and BB8 take formation with a cluster of 5 other X-Wings, 
following the convoy.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Laura Dern sits up at the tactical ops table as green dots 
grow in number and begin to close in on a red dot.
Leia sits in the background. C3PO by her side.
Leia looks around, there’s a faint whisper of ‘Leia?’ and she 
gets up.
C3PO follows as Leia leaves the room.
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang walk into the 
room and push past folk to stand before Laura Dern.
FINN
Ma’am, sir, ma’am.
Laura Dern looks over to the two underlings.
LAURA DERN
Why are you not on duty?
FINN
Listen, Ma’am, this girl here...
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Kelly.
FINN
Kelly, here, her sister says 
there’s a First Order ship orbiting 
Expraxis right now.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
A juggernaut. Not been there long.
FINN
These guys don’t send ships out for 
search parties. I’ve been there, if 
they’re sending out a destroyer it 
means business.
Laura Dern stands up.
23.
LAURA DERN
Listen here, my intel says all 
First Order communications are 
coming from Jolez, we’ve found no 
other signals across the galaxy.
FINN
If you’ve found any signals from 
the First Order, it’s because they 
wanted you to find them. These guys 
go deep in encryption.
LAURA DERN
If you think we’re turning the 
entire fleet around on a hunch from 
a cadet and... a turncoat.
FINN
Listen to me, you are sending every 
chance of the resistance into a 
shooting gallery.
LAURA DERN
Get out of my briefing room right 
now. You wish to be of use to the 
Resistance? Hop in a ship and fly 
to Jolez.
Laura Dern sits back down at the table.
Finn lets out a yell and steps back.
FINN
Someone here’s gotta wanna listen 
to this info.
A look at Leia’s abandoned chair.
INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - SPACE NIGHT
Kylo’s spaceship sits in the hangar bay, troopers march on in 
single file.
Kylo walks towards the ship.
Captain PHASMA salutes Kylo and marches with him.
PHASMA
Why did you choose me for this 
mission, sir?
24.
KYLO
Every time you’ve deployed with me 
everyone we meet winds up dead. 
It’s as good a track record as 
anyone could want.
PHASMA
Glad to be of service, I guess.
They head into the ship, the walkway rises into the ship and 
it begins to fly out of the bay, into space.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - HALLWAY - EVENING
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang head down the 
walkways and biways, then stop as a door opens.
INT. LEIA’S CHAMBER
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang stand at the 
door, C3PO stands to one side as Leia stares at a wall.
Leia looks over.
LEIA
Oh, hello.
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang walk into the 
room. The door shuts behind them.
LEIA (CONT’D)
How’s your back?
Finn nods.
FINN
Fixing up, General.
LEIA
Good to hear. What do you need?
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks to Finn in 
astonishment.
Finn walks over to Leia.
FINN
We believe the First Order is 
surrounding a planet right now, 
possibly scouting new base 
locations. 
(MORE)
25.
Laura Dern won’t listen, she 
doesn’t want to stop her assault.
Leia nods.
LEIA
She’s head-strong, do you have any 
physical evidence?
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang shakes her head.
FINN
Just witness accounts.
LEIA
Ok. Take a ship over to the planet, 
scout out any First Order business 
and report back. Whatever you do, 
don’t engage without back-up. We 
can’t lose any more people.
(Beat)
I can’t lose anyone else.
Finn hugs Leia.
FINN
You’re the best, General.
Leia hands Finn a datapad.
LEIA
Those are the hangar codes, don’t 
lose them, for goodness sake.
Finn nods.
FINN
I’ll do you proud.
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang leave the 
room in a rush.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - SHIP DOCKING ROOM
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang enter a small 
room with a few control panels, mostly lit in red.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
What are we looking for?
FINN
Any ship still left in dock.
FINN (CONT'D)
26.
They both look around the panels, until they come across a 
green light.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Over here.
FINN
Ok.
Finn takes out the datapad and taps a combination below the 
light.
It goes from green to red.
FINN (CONT’D)
Unlocked.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Where is it?
FINN
It’ll be coming up to the hangars.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - NIGHT
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang rush out of 
the base and head to the hangars.
Finn stops and looks ahead.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
What?
FINN
No way.
We see the Millennium Falcon landing ahead of the two of 
them.
Chewbacca holds the Porg, petting it, and walks down the 
walkway of the Falcon, leaving the hangar.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Finn?
Finn shakes his head.
FINN
Every time.
Finn looks over to Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang.
27.
FINN (CONT’D)
It’s nothing. Hop on.
They head for the Falcon.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT
Rey wanders back to the site she found Luke, she leans over 
the cliff the lightsaber was tossed.
REY
It’s not that far down.
A gust of wind hits, pushing Rey a little closer to the edge.
REY (CONT’D)
Maybe a little.
Rey steps back. Onto R2D2, who trundles around.
R2D2
Whistle bleep bleep.
REY
Hey Artoo.
R2D2
Bleep whistle whistle.
Rey shakes her head and sits on the ground, R2D2 leans onto 
Rey.
REY
He’s not like I thought he’d be. 
Mean, angry, grumpy. He’s like an 
old man.
R2D2
Bleep bleep whistle.
LUKE (O.S.)
I heard that.
R2D2
Bleep bleep.
Rey looks over, Luke stands in the darkness, walking towards 
the light.
LUKE
Artoo?
R2D2 moves towards Luke.
28.
R2D2
Whistle.
Luke almost smiles.
LUKE
They dragged you back into all this 
too?
R2D2 rocks his body back and forth, looking like a nod.
Rey stands up.
R2D2
Whistle bleep.
Luke puts his hand on R2D2.
LUKE
You’re looking good at least, one 
of us aged well.
REY
What are you doing out here?
Luke looks to Rey.
LUKE
I admit I was harsh on you. Not 
used to other people these days. To 
find your path in the force you 
first have to find the force in 
your path. There’s a bank of 
crystal south east of here that 
amplifies the force, if you can 
bring back some of that, we can 
begin your training.
REY
How do I know where they are?
Luke taps his forehead.
LUKE
You’ll feel it.
Luke looks to R2D2 with a ‘duh’ face. It’s a gif-able moment.
REY
Right away master.
LUKE
Don’t call me master. I’m just some 
old guy.
29.
REY
Ok.
Rey jogs off.
R2D2 turns to Luke.
R2D2
Whistle beep.
LUKE
She doesn’t know that.
R2D2 runs into Luke’s leg.
LUKE (CONT’D)
What’s with you?
R2D2
Whistle.
LUKE
Well follow her if you feel that 
way.
R2D2 turns and rolls in the direction Rey went.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Silly droid.
EXT. SPACE - SPACE NIGHT
The Resistance fleet exits hyperspace and appears before a 
planetary system.
We go between cockpits.
POE
This is Red Seven, reporting in.
PORKINS JUNIOR
Red Three reading you loud and 
clear.
DEMADRE OLAGLANTHINE
Red Five copying.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
In a low-light environment, we see three engineers, two 
pilots and Captain RESUSTUS WAGATITO, a Mon Calamari, looking 
at the same holo-screen as Resistance Base.
30.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Silver One reads you all. We’re 
picking up seismic activity on the 
third planet up ahead. You have 
clearance for approach.
EXT. SPACE
The huge Resistance Spaceship unleashes waves of transport 
ships, as Poe’s X-Wing unit travel with them to a grey planet 
deep in the system.
INT. RESISTANCE TRANSPORT SHIP
A squadron of Resistance fighters sit, backs to the wall, 
facing one-another, in a dark ship hull.
Among them we see JING-KLAT BOOVE, a 30-35 year old human 
male, OOF BEFESDA, a 30-35 year old human woman, with a scar 
down the right side of her face, and RATTER BALANSIKOV, a 
Nautolan like Kit Fisto (Real name of a character in the 
prequels, George Lucas just let google autocomplete that 
stuff. The Death Sticks guy’s surname was Sleazebaggiano for 
pete’s sake).
JING-KLAT
We land in T-minus 5, check your 
load-outs everyone, this could get 
messy.
OOF
Getting read-out of the planet.
Soldiers check and load-up heavy blasters and bag up various 
equipment in bags. Ratter takes out a datapad.
RATTER
Scout info says atmosphere is 
clear. Strong orbital pull, take 
only the necessities, no helmets.
Troops throw helmets off their heads and unpack a few largergrade weapons.
EXT. VANAGARA (THE GREY PLANET)
Five shuttles fly through the atmosphere and shake as they 
come speeding towards the ground.
31.
INT. RESISTANCE TRANSPORT SHIP
The interior is shaking.
JING-KLAT
Hold on tight. Pilot, take it easy, 
we’ll have to jump out.
Everyone gets up and heads to the back of the ship.
EXT. VANAGARA
Shuttle doors open as the ships near the ground.
Troops leap out with little equipment, they form a large 
circle in the middle of nowhere.
OOF
Form up, get eyes on the horizon.
Shuttles begin to take back off as everyone takes aim and/or 
binoculars towards the many directions of seeming-infinity.
Jing-Klat kneels to the ground, he rubs the grey dust to 
reveal red underneath.
He licks the dust.
JING-KLAT
Salt.
RATTER
Salt? How, there’s no water.
OOF
Anymore.
EXT. SPACE
Poe sits in his cockpit, looking down at the planet as a 
tactical screen of the planet sits on his dashboard. There’s 
a cluster of green dots with nothing else nearby.
POE
This is Red Seven, if you can hear 
us down there, report back. Air 
support may not be possible with 
the planet’s pull.
32.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
We’re seeing movement north-east of 
your position.
A red dot appears on the holo-screen.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Laura Dern leans in to the red dot on her screen.
LAURA DERN
What is that? Where are the First 
Order?
People scramble to type into machines around Laura Dern.
EXT. SPACE
Poe leans in to look down to the planet.
POE
What are we reading here? Can we 
get eyes?
EXT. VANAGARA (THE GREY PLANET)
Three different troops turn their binoculars towards the 
north-east.
POV: We see stretches of grey dust and brown-grey sky going 
in and out of focus.
And then one little bit of grey movement.
ARTEMIS GORANTHIMER (O.S.)
I see something. Can’t place it. 
Hold on.
There’s a thunderous sound echoing across the land.
And suddenly.
That movement.
Is the head of an AT-AT WALKER.
A blast of RED.
33.
ARTEMIS GORANTHIMER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Oh no. It’s a walker.
EXT. SPACE
Poe’s eyes widen.
POE
No.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
LAURA DERN
Did they say a walker? The first 
Order has walkers now?
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Watch yourself out there.
EXT. SPACE
POE
Get out of there now.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO (V.O.)
Negative, Blue squadron, we need 
eyes.
POE
Without support we may not have 
anything left.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO (V.O.)
Watch it Red Seven.
Poe shakes his head and takes his X-Wing towards the 
Resistance ship.
EXT. VANAGARA
On the opposite side of the troops a blast of salt and red 
earth explodes into the sky.
OOF
They’re firing at us.
A trooper looking through binoculars waves his arm.
34.
FANGIBAL THETARITUS
More movement south east.
Jing-Klat turns and grabs the binoculars. He looks out.
JING-KLAT
Ambush. It’s an ambush.
Another hit of salt and earth a little away from the troops.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Laura Dern stares at the screen.
A red dot appears south-east of the green dots.
And a few more red dots between them.
LAURA DERN
There it is, everyone. We’ve found 
the First Order. Take them down.
EXT. VANAGARA
Two troopers reveal large rockets and take aim at the 
walkers.
JING-KLAT
Fire.
Rockets shoot off.
We see five walkers, heads sinking a little towards the 
ground.
Rockets fly towards the legs.
BOOM
SMASH
The rockets hit the ground half a parsec away from the 
walkers.
THEDGE MACKLINTOCK
It’s no use sir, the planet’s pull 
is weighing down the rockets.
OOF
Ok everyone, bunker down, don’t 
give them a target.
35.
Troops begin to sink hands into the ground, digging it up infront of them.
EXT. SPACE
The X-Wings head into the hangars of the Resistance 
Spaceship.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP HANGAR
Poe jumps out of his X-Wing as others land.
BB8 hops out and follows Poe down the room, into a hallway.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
Poe bursts into the room.
POE
Captain, we’ve gotta make a move 
before we lose everything down 
there. We need to initiate an air 
attack.
Resustus turns to Poe as the red dots gain ground on the 
screen.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Red seven, you have no right 
bursting in on this bridge. Get 
back in your ship and watch out for 
any exterior forces.
POE
Whilst everyone down there is about 
to die?
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
What would you have us do, Dameron?
POE
The F-Fighters are pressureenforced. Made for underwater 
attacks.
Resustus shakes his head.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Those things barely function 
anymore, we just haven’t been able 
to scrap them yet.
36.
POE
I can fly them, my squadron can do 
it. Let us help.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Admiral Dern?
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
The Resistance force is doing background work very well.
LAURA DERN
Negative, do not send more forces 
on the ground. Can you initiate an 
orbital strike?
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
The targets are closing in, we 
can’t be completely accurate.
LAURA DERN
What’s the casualty ratio?
Resustus looks to some of his engineers. Someone hands him a 
datapad.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Eight to one.
Poe’s jaw drops, he looks horrified.
LAURA DERN
Ok. Do it.
POE
No.
LAURA DERN
Stand down, Captain.
POE
Admiral!
LAURA DERN
Stand down captain, or you will be 
detained.
We make note of two heavy-duty security troops standing by 
the doorway.
37.
Poe lifts his head back.
POE
ARGH.
LAURA DERN
Captain, strike these First Order 
bantha, hard.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Affirmative.
Poe walks out of the room, hitting the wall on the way.
EXT. SPACE
The Resistance Spaceship maneuvers to face the planet, two 
large cannons appear at its front.
Just as they are aiming to shoot, we hear a BOOM.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - WOODS - NIGHT
CU: A huge tree trunk on the ground, it breaks with the same 
BOOM.
R2D2’s wheel trundles over it.
We pull back to reveal it’s a tiny twig.
R2D2 looks around, trees everywhere, no sign of Rey.
R2D2
Whistle beep beep.
R2D2 keeps wheeling through the woodlands.
A small CHATTER of noise breaks through.
Then hint of FOOTSTEPS.
R2D2 spins around.
R2D2 (CONT’D)
Whistle beep WAAAAAO.
R2D2 stops. The noise stops.
Nothing.
Another CRACK of a twig.
38.
R2D2 turns.
From a hole in a tree, a PORG jumps out onto R2D2, it lands 
on the droid’s head and taps it with their small beak.
R2D2 (CONT’D)
Beep beep whistle.
R2D2 spins around and the Porg flies off.
The Porg runs off, R2D2 keeps trundling down the woods.
Another twig SNAPS.
R2D2 turns around.
A small army of Porgs run towards R2D2 and leap all over it.
R2D2 (CONT’D)
WAAAAAAAAOOOOOOO.
R2D2 spins around but the Porgs overtake him.
A figure in the shadows runs towards R2D2.
REY
Go.
Rey waves her hand as she comes into the light, the Porgs are 
seemingly pushed off R2D2.
The get back up and look at Rey and R2D2.
One Porg hisses at them, then they all run off.
Rey dusts R2D2 off and looks at it.
REY (CONT’D)
Are you ok?
R2D2
Whistle beep beep bloop.
REY
It looked like it, I just lent a 
hand.
Rey stands back up.
REY (CONT’D)
Did he send you to keep an eye on 
me?
39.
R2D2
Whistle Beep.
REY
Oh, thanks. Is there much you can 
do here?
R2D2
Whistle whistle beep beep beep.
REY
Ok, sorry. You just looked a little 
helpless a moment ago.
R2D2
Beep beep whistle.
REY
I guess we’ll see. Follow me, I 
sense we’re close.
Rey walks back into the darkness, R2D2 looks around one last 
moment and follows.
INT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK
Luke sits down in his shack, he closes his eyes.
LUKE
Old habits, here goes nothing.
We push into Luke’s beardy face.
And kick back out hard, flying out of the shack, and out of 
orbit of the planet, into...
EXT. SPACE
We ping-pong between planets and solar systems until we crash 
into...
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE 
The Millenium Falcon sitting in wait.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang rush into the 
cockpit. Finn looks around at all the buttons and points at a 
few of them, mouthing things to himself.
40.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang sits down in the pilot 
seat and clicks some buttons.
FINN
Woah, hey, what are you doing?
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang turns to Finn.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Getting this thing started up, take 
a seat. This might get bumpy.
FINN
You know how to fly this thing?
Finn sits down.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
I know how to fly. This looks 
really antiquated, but I’m sure 
most of the systems are the same.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang clicks a button, the 
Falcon jolts forward a moment.
Finn hits the dashboard, then sits back down.
FINN
Easy.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Well at least we know how to land 
now.
Finn slowly puts on the seatbelts.
FINN
What about this lever?
Finn puts his hand on a lever between the two of them.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Nothing for you to handle.
Finn takes his hand off but quick.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang taps a few more 
buttons and then lifts the steering wheel towards her.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE
The ship kangaroos a few steps before taking to the sky.
41.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
FINN
Woo!
Finn punches his fist into the air, he hits a button up top.
The exterior goes blurry.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Hit that button again.
Finn reaches and hits the button.
They jolt forward in their seats.
Outside we see a planet suddenly appear.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
(CONT’D)
Oh no.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang turns the wheel in 
different directions.
EXT. SPACE
The Falcon swerves out of the way of a planet and into 
darkness.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang wipes sweat off her 
brow. Finn chuckles.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
That’s most of the hyperdrive
engine wiped.
LUKE (V.O.)
(Fuzzy)
Han?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
What did you say?
FINN
Huh?
LUKE (V.O.)
Where are you?
42.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang turns around, seeing 
nothing.
FINN
Are you alright?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Just echoes of something.
We kick out of the Falcon and fly through...
EXT. SPACE
Back to the Resistance Base planet, and into the...
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - HALLWAY
As tech and engineers run down to the Briefing Room.
We fly into...
INT. LEIA'S CHAMBER
As Leia sits at a desk, facing into the ether.
LUKE (V.O.)

Leia’s eyes react.
LEIA

C3PO turns to Leia.
C3PO
General?
Luke appears in blue before Leia, she stands.
LEIA
Luke, you’re here.
INT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK
Luke sits, eyes open, as Leia in blue appears before him.
LUKE
I can’t find Han.
43.
Leia shakes her head.
LEIA
Where have you been? We need you.
LUKE
The universe is better without me.
LEIA
I need you.
LUKE
Leia...
LEIA
He killed him, Luke.
Luke stares at Leia.
LUKE
Ben... I’m... I...
LEIA
Don’t.
LUKE
I shouldn’t have...
LEIA
You did nothing.
Luke nods.
LUKE
I did everything.
INT. LEIA'S CHAMBER
Luke disappears, Leia stands facing nothing. A tear runs down 
her face.
Chewbacca walks over to Leia and hugs her. We push in on 
Chewbacca’s face.
INT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK
Luke’s eyes are closed again.
LUKE
I’m sorry.
Luke opens his eyes again.
44.
INT. LEIA'S CHAMBER
Chewbacca moves his arms away from Leia.
CHEWBACCA
Roaaaar.
Leia touches Chewbacca’s face.
LEIA
I know.
There’s a rumble of footsteps outside.
Leia looks over to the door.
She hops to it, walking out of the room.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - COAST - NIGHT
Rey and R2D2 leave the woods and find themselves at land’s 
end. Waves crash towards them.
R2D2
Whistle.
REY
I’m not sure. It’s somewhere.
Rey and R2D2 head to the very edge of the land.
Beyond, we see an ocean, with a very wavy light emanating 
under it.
Rey closes her eyes and reaches out.
The light grows stronger.
R2D2
Whistle beep beep.
The light grows stronger until a large crystalised rock 
breaks out of the water.
Rey’s arms shake, she lets out a moan and drops to her knees.
REY
Aaaargh.
Rey opens her eyes, the crystal crashes back down onto the 
water and begins to sink out of view.
45.
REY (CONT’D)
No.
Rey looks over to R2D2.
REY (CONT’D)
You can’t float by any chance?
R2D2
Whistle whistle.
R2D2 backs away from the water.
REY
Can you at least lend a hand?
R2D2 pops open a compartment, a cable appears.
Rey grabs it.
REY (CONT’D)
Thanks.
(Taking a deep breath)
Here goes nothing.
Rey runs towards the edge, the cable keeps flowing from R2D2.
Rey dives into the water.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - UNDERWATER
Rey dives down into a dark sea.
The crystals shine before her, a little too far to reach.
Rey keeps swimming.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - COAST
R2D2 bounces around as the cable spurts from its interior.
R2D2 is suddenly pulled closer to the water as the cable 
reaches its end.
R2D2 pulls back, spikes come out of its wheels and dig into 
the ground.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - UNDERWATER
Rey swims, then the cable pulls her back.
46.
Rey tries to drag the cable closer.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - COAST
R2D2 is yanked a little closer to the water.
The wheels spin backwards and the droid reverses again.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - UNDERWATER
Rey is dragged a little back.
She looks at the cable, then forward, where the crystal 
deposit glows.
Rey reaches out.
The deposit shakes and begins to move.
It comes closer and closer, nearly blindingly light.
Rey reaches out with one hand, she touches the crystal.
Rey tries to get the cable closer to the crystal.
She yanks once, twice...
EXT. IRISH PLANET - COAST
R2D2 jolts forward. And again. And finally is dragged over 
the edge.
R2D2
WOAAAAAAAAH
R2D2 powers up thrusters and flies back.
The cable begins to retract.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - UNDERWATER
The cable flies out of Rey’s hand, she spins around, grabbing 
onto the crystal, breaking off a piece as she loses all 
control.
Rey lets out a gasp of air, the deposit drops down, she swims 
after it but begins to lose consciousness.
POV: The light from the crystal fades away, a hint of light 
from the broken piece floats nearby.
47.
Things go in and out of focus, as a swarm swims closer and 
closer.
We see Rey give out one last bubble of air and her eyes 
close.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - COAST
R2D2 lands near the woods.
Behind it, Porgs come swarming out running into the water and 
diving.
R2D2 is pushed along with them.
R2D2
Whistle beeep woooooah.
R2D2 fires up the boosters, a few Porgs get hit by fire and 
scatter around until they hit the water.
R2D2 fires its cable to a tree and flies over to a safe spot 
as Porgs rush the water in droves.
Further down the coast, by a large cliff wall, Rey is pushed 
up to the rocks by a swarm of Porgs.
R2D2 flies over.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - ROCKS
R2D2 lands near Rey’s body.
R2D2
Whistle beep beep.
R2D2 bumps Rey a few times with one leg.
Nothing.
R2D2 takes out an electric prod and hits Rey.
She sits up, spitting out water.
Rey looks at R2D2 and a bunch of Porgs standing around.
REY
What? How did...
Rey looks beyond the Porgs.
48.
REY (CONT’D)
Is that...
We see a Porg hop off a rock.
Luke’s Lightsaber sits, broken, on the rocks.
Rey reaches over and grabs it.
REY (CONT’D)
Oh.
Rey looks at R2D2.
REY (CONT’D)
Don’t tell Master Skywalker.
R2D2
Beep beep.
A Porg makes a squeal, then spits up the broken piece of 
crystal.
Rey smiles and picks up the crystal, then pats the Porg on 
the head.
REY
You’re not so bad.
Other Porgs waddle over to Rey and place their heads on her.
EXT. MILLENIUM FALCON - SPACE NIGHT
The Falcon screams through space.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang clicks buttons as the 
ship comfortably sails.
Finn keeps an eye on her.
FINN
How’d you pick up all this flying 
stuff?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Santha and I lived on a planet 
called M’ba’grana for the first ten 
years of my life. 
(MORE)
49.
It was an Empire outpost for the 
longest time, abandoned and left to 
rust and starve.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang clicks the autopilot 
on and leans back.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
(CONT’D)
Most days we’d play in fallen ship 
husks, Santha would be a rich and 
beloved performer, flying through 
space, going from big venue to big 
venue. I would be a pilot, shooting 
down the Empire and picking up 
people, taking them to a new, 
better life.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks out to space.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
(CONT’D)
I started piecing bits of ships 
together, I was gonna fly the two 
of us out of there, and into the 
stars. Then the First Order started 
enlisting. Our dad took up arms to 
pay to shuttle us off.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang shakes her head.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
(CONT’D)
Santha was older, she was moved up 
the list and shuttled out. I was 
left on M’ba’grana alone. My father 
was shot down soon after and the 
Order cut communication entirely. 
So I began building a ship, it was 
junky and broken, but it got me out 
of there. Just. I crashed on a moon 
some systems over. The distress 
beacon worked, thankfully. I was 
picked up by Resistance scouts, and 
helped out with ship maintenance.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang shrugs.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
(CONT’D)
It wasn’t shooting down the Empire 
but it was at least helping out.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG 
BANG (CONT'D)
50.
FINN
So how’d you find your sister 
again?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
One of the engineers spent a week 
losing everything on a Sebak table, 
was sure he saw me walking past on 
a hand and got distracted. He ran 
up to her and discovered who she 
was. She handed him a direct 
holocom, I’ve kept it close ever 
since.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang taps gently on her 
coat pocket, by her heart.
Finn smiles softly.
FINN
In all of the galaxy, to never 
truly lose one another, that’s 
special.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang smiles.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
I feel lucky.
She turns to Finn.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
(CONT’D)
What about you, do you have anyone 
out there?
Finn nods.
FINN
I think I do.
We move out into the darkness of space. Just BLACK, and 
quiet.
EXT. VANAGARA - DAY
The black and silence is scratched away as we see Resistance 
troop digging through towards us, we are below the soil.
Above ground, we see the circle of troops having created a 
small wall of dirt around them, and are bunkering down 
considerably.
51.
THUMP
Walkers keep coming, closing in slowly.
Besides them giant RED BEAMS crash, causing dirt to explode 
and cover the air in salt and red dust.
One RED BEAM hits metres away from the troop encampment.
People fall and dust themselves off.
OOF
Are we ok?
Soldiers nod and give thumbs up.
JING-KLAT
Hey, we’re getting hit hard down 
here, watch the strikes.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
Resustus sits looking at the holo-screen and the planet in 
the window outside.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
We can’t be exact, we’re just 
trying to provide cover.
JING-KLAT (V.O.)
Well too many more of those and 
we’ll be gone.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Leia, C3PO and Chewbacca walk into the room. People stop 
working to salute Leia.
LEIA
At ease.
Leia sits next to Laura Dern.
LAURA DERN
General, welcome back.
LEIA
Can I get a sit-rep?
Laura Dern nods, two techies rush over with datapads.
52.
EXT. SPACE
The Resistance Spaceship fires off more orbital strikes.
EXT. VANAGARA
A Walker shoots, then is hit by a RED BEAM and explodes.
Another RED BEAM hits close to the Resistance troops, a few 
bodies fly. They do not get up.
JING-KLAT
We’ve got units down here, cease 
fire, cease fire.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP - HALLWAY
Poe rushes down a hallway, he stops as we hear ‘Cease Fire’.
POE
No.
Poe doubles his speed.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP HANGAR
Poe runs into the hangar, the X-Wings have all landed and the 
pilots are standing, waiting.
Poe stops running and stands in front of everyone.
DEMADRE OLAGLANTHINE
What are our orders Captain?
POE
Orders?
PORKINS JUNIOR
Yes sir.
Poe looks at every man, woman and calamari before him.
He shakes his head.
POE
We’re grounded, hold steady.
BB8 rolls up to Poe.
BB8
Bleep bleep boop.
53.
POE
I know, I know.
EXT. VANAGARA
The troops dig in further, Oof looks to Ratter.
OOF
Remember Wandada?
RATTER
All too well.
Oof takes two thermal detonators out of her satchel, Ratter 
nods and takes one.
JING-KLAT
What’s going on up there, do we 
have an exit strategy?
(Beat)
Hello?
EXT. SPACE
Kylo’s ship flies through space.
INT. KYLO’S SPACESHIP
Kylo, Captain Phasma and two pilots sit in a cockpit area, 
with screens around them. It is lowlight.
There’s an increase in pings on a scanner.
A pilot adjusts the frequency.
The scanner’s wavelength goes mad.
Kylo looks to Captain Phasma and puts on his helmet.
EXT. SPACE
Kylo’s ship descends into an Earthy, dirt-based planet.
HOGOLAN.
EXT. HOGOLAN - PLAINS - DAY
Kylo’s ship lands. Stormtroopers march onto the cracked dirt 
ground.
54.
These are probably famous people in cameos. I’m guessing 
Jason Statham and Maggie Smith, probably Martin Clunes and 
Neil Morrissey too, people love those guys.
Kylo and Captain Phasma walk onto the planet’s surface.
PHASMA
Form up.
The troopers make two lines before the ranking characters.
CELEB STORMTROOPER 1
Captain, signal appears to be 
coming from over there.
The trooper points. This is a big role for a cameo, so will 
need to be played by a decent actor. David Beckham, maybe.
Kylo turns his lightsaber on.
KYLO
Let’s go hunting.
Kylo walks past the troopers.
PHASMA
Alpha squadron, on me, Beta 
squadron, take point.
CELEB STORMTROOPER 2
Yes captain.
The troopers move, some circle the ship, others follow Kylo, 
as does Captain Phasma.
CU: A trooper’s hand holds a scanner, it pings louder and 
louder.
Kylo begins to move swifter towards the ping.
Before them there’s an opening to a cave.
Captain Phasma nods to a trooper, they fire a few shots into 
the cave.
KYLO
Well, we’ve lost our surprise.
PHASMA
This is how we manoeuvre.
KYLO
No point being subtle now, I guess.
55.
Kylo runs right into the cave mouth.
INT. CAVE
Kylo’s lightsaber illuminates the increasingly dark cave.
There’s no sound except the buzzing of his blade.
Behind Kylo, Phasma and two troopers follow.
BANG
A green blast shoots from deep inside the cave.
Kylo waves his hand, the blast hits the ceiling.
Some rock falls.
Troopers fire towards the shot’s origin.
KYLO
Wait.
PHASMA
Cease fire.
The troopers stop shooting.
Kylo stands, gripping his lightsaber hilt tight.
Tens of blaster shots fire off towards them.
Kylo deflects them with his blade, he runs towards them.
Deeper in, there’s four people shooting with blaster rifles.
Kylo slices a blaster, it explodes, more rubble and rock.
He slashes someone, and pushes another towards the ground.
Kylo picks the last one up with the force and begins to crush 
their helmet.
The grounded enemy aims her gun at Kylo.
She’s about to shoot.
Kylo flings the other body away.
ZAP
The grounded enemy falls back down.
56.
Captain Phasma holds a blaster to the enemy, she looks over 
to Kylo who looks back to her.
Kylo nods.
PHASMA (CONT’D)
You’re welcome.
Kylo walks even deeper into the cave.
All light is Kylo’s red glow now.
RANDOM RESISTANCE ALLY (O.S.)
Stay back.
KYLO
Come out peacefully and you will be 
spared.
RANDOM RESISTANCE ALLY
Never.
A few enemies fire from various angles.
Kylo waves them away and throws his lightsaber towards one.
The enemy is seen by the red light going through their chest.
Kylo takes the blade back.
He leaps towards another, slashes, then throws the saber 
again.
Troopers toss in some syfy glowsticks and we see there’s 
nobody left.
In the middle of the end of the cave, a signal beacon sits.
A small blue light from the middle.
A trooper goes over and plugs in their radar.
CELEB STORMTROOPER 3
Getting their comms now. Tracking.
KABLAMMO!
A blaster shot hits the ceiling above the trooper.
Some rock falls.
Kylo and Phasma look to the origin.
Kylo reaches out his hand.
57.
A CHILD floats towards Kylo.
KYLO
Aren’t you a little young to be 
with the resistance?
The Child drops the blaster in their hand. Kylo puts them 
down.
KYLO (CONT’D)
Were... were they your parents?
The Child nods.
Kylo turns off his lightsaber. The cave is now lit by the 
blue glowsticks.
KYLO (CONT’D)
I’m sorry. I know what it’s like to 
lose a father.
Captain Phasma looks over to the Trooper, who gives a thumb 
up.
PHASMA
We have what we need.
(To Kylo)
Let’s move out.
Kylo takes off his helmet and kneels down to the Child.
KYLO
Don’t be afraid. We won’t hurt you.
PHASMA
Master Ren?
Kylo looks to Phasma, and the troopers.
KYLO
Pack up, I’ll meet you at the ship.
PHASMA
Yes sir.
Phasma and the Stormtroopers leave the cave.
Kylo looks back at the Child.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT
58.
Laura Dern and Leia and C3PO and Chewbacca and a gathering of 
Resistance intelligence officers stare at the holo-screen as 
3 red dots still inch closer to a number of green dots.
JING-KLAT (V.O.)
Cease Fire! Mayday! We’re losing 
soldiers!
(BUZZ)
‘ldiers
Static prevails.
The voice comes in again, but faintly, before stopping 
entirely.
LAURA DERN
Hello? Come in?
EXT. VANAGARA - DAY
In the partially-dug bunker, Oof, Ratter, Jing-Kang and 
twelve other soldiers are digging, Oof and Ratter seem to be 
digging diagonally.
There are bodies everywhere.
JING-KLAT
Base, confirm?
(Beat)
Base?
OOF
We need hands.
JING-KLAT
We’ve lost contact.
Jing-Klat heads to Oof and starts digging.
RATTER
Then we haven’t much time.
Jing-Klat looks down, into horizontal hole.
He begins to claw away at the ground too.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP - HALLWAY
Poe and BB8 head down the hall and into...
59.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
Where Resustus and the team are trying to gain a signal.
The holo-screens are not giving any information.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
I said we’ve lost visual...
Resustus turns to see Poe.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO (CONT’D)
Dameron?
Poe looks at the mayhem, as a few more blasts head down to 
the planet.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
POE
Cease fire.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
What? You have no authority.
Poe pushes a gunner off their console.
POE
Comms down, who has authority now? 
If we can’t see what we’re even 
aiming at, why fire?
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Our troops our down their, they 
need help.
Poe walks right up to Resustus.
POE
So we help them.
(Beat)
I help them.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
No, Poe.
POE
Give me a better idea in the next 
five seconds.
Poe walks out of the room, BB8 follows along.
Resustus looks to his team.
60.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Curse him. Get this thing 
connected, no dawdling.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP - STOCK LEVEL
Red Squadron walk into the large stock room, where towering 
but seemingly aged space ships stand.
Poe and BB8 stand before one of the ships.
POE
Squadron, we’ve got a battle and a 
half in front of us, and these 
machines, well, they’ve seen better 
days.
The Squadron nod.
POE (CONT’D)
But I know not one of you would 
rather sit here and wait than head 
down and fight for our own.
SQUADRON
Yeah, yes, right on, various 
noises.
POE
I’m guessing none of you has 
piloted one of these beasts before?
People shake their head.
Porkins Junior nods.
PORKINS JUNIOR
My dad taught me.
POE
Good.
(Beat)
For the others, your droids have 
basic piloting instructions added. 
Getting down to the planet’s 
surface will be their job.
Poe looks at the ships.
POE (CONT’D)
After that...
Poe turns back.
61.
POE (CONT’D)
After that, we make those First 
Order scoundrels pay with every 
ounce of our might.
The Squadron punch the air and clap.
POE (CONT’D)
Let’s do this.
INT. F-FIGHTER COCKPIT SEVEN
Poe hops into the cockpit of a space-dusty ship.
BB8 pops into the back of the ship, seen through the cockpit.
We see various other pilots do the same.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
A red light flashes on a console.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
What is that?
BOGATO CANALBOAT
(Reading console)
The cargo hull, sir, it’s been 
opened.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Dameron!
EXT. SPACE
Under the Resistance Spaceship, large hatches open and FFIGHTERS fall out and float.
INT. F-FIGHTER COCKPIT SEVEN
Poe clicks a button.
BB8
Whistle Bleep.
POE
Red squadron, engines on, let’s 
change this battle.
62.
EXT. SPACE
F-Fighter engines burst to life, blue lights emanating.
They all begin to zoom towards Vangara.
EXT. VANAGARA
Jing-Klat, Oof and Ratter are now so deep in a hole, it’s 
getting dark.
Soil from above drops down as vibrations and thumps from 
walker feet increases.
OOF
Now?
Ratter shakes his head.
RATTER
Turn back.
OOF
What?
Ratter grabs the thermal detonator from Oof.
RATTER
Turn back.
Oof looks at Ratter, she solemnly hands him her detonator.
Jing-Klat looks at the two of them.
JING-KLAT
No.
Oof grabs Jing-Klat and drags him back out the hole.
JING-KLAT (CONT’D)
NO!
Ratter clicks the detonators.
ABOVE GROUND
The three remaining WALKERS shoot at the hole, hitting it 
hard.
As the middle walker’s foot hits the ground, an explosion 
from underground brings up soil and salt.
63.
The walker’s foot falls through the ground, and the head 
topples to the ground.
There’s an explosion, and the Walker smashes into a few 
pieces.
The other two WALKERS keep moving.
FURTHER AFIELD
The F-FIGHTERS come down to surface level, engines firing 
upwards as gravity pulls down.
They all touch ground with a bottom feeler entering the soil.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
The screens begin to show some basic radar from the FFighters’ perspective.
A droid whirls into a console.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Red Squadron, can you hear me?
POE (V.O.)
(Crackling)
Faintly, Captain.
INT. F-FIGHTER COCKPIT SEVEN
Poe looks around, other pilots salute.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO (V.O.)
You’re some way off, on your six.
EXT. VANAGARA
The ships slowly turn to their right and shoot off.
Soil and salt are kicked up by their feelers.
A constant trail of red.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Finn snores loudly, a jolt of the ship wakes him up.
FINN
No, you’re the bantha farmer!
64.
Finn looks over to Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang.
FINN (CONT’D)
Sup girl?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
We’re approaching Expraxis. Figured 
it’d be best if you were awake at 
some point.
FINN
Just avoiding jetlag.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang smiles at Finn’s notgood joke because he’s charming.
EXT. EXPRAXIS SYSTEM
The Millenium Falcon stops hyperspacing and floats on one 
side of a planet lit up like a million neon signs vomited 
into a Nicholas Winding Refn movie.
A huge STAR DESTROYER hovers on the other side of the planet.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang look over to 
the Destroyer.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
How do we get past that without 
being spotted?
Finn shrugs.
FINN
I find it best to just go and do 
what you wanna do and deal with the 
consequences later.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
You’re saying land right now?
FINN
If they shoot us down, at least we 
made it to the right planet.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang shakes her head.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Hold on to something then.
65.
EXT. EXPRAXIS SYSTEM
The Falcon heads to Expraxis, we see the duo staring at the 
Star Destroyer the whole time.
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE
From the window we can see Expraxis, and the Falcon heading 
down.
Domhnall is looking at a screen in front of the window, 
showing the situation on Vangara.
DOMHNALL
Come on, there can’t be many left. 
Just keep shooting!
RAVIOLI MANCARATTCHI
Sir...
DOMHNALL
Not now!
EXT. EXPRAXIS DOCK - NIGHT OR SOME APPROXIMATION
The Falcon lands on a dock high in the skyline, behind we see 
neon flashing lights forever.
There’s a sense of party in every speaker of the Dolby Atmos
mix.
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang exit the ship 
and look around.
A figure approaches.
The figure removes their hood, it is ELAN Sel’Sbaagano Jr.
ELAN
You wanna buy death sticks?
Finn waves his hand at Elan.
FINN
Nah man.
Elan shudders at the hand wave.
ELAN
Oh no, you’re not another jedi are 
you? My father warned me of you.
66.
Elan throws his dubious material on the floor and runs off.
Finn looks at Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang.
FINN
Making friends already. Where do we 
go?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Follow the action.
The duo head off into a sea of neon.
EXT. VANAGARA
Oof and Jing-Klat pop their heads out of the hole and see two 
Walkers closing in on them.
They look back at the cave they dug.
OOF
Any last minute grand plans?
Jing-Klat looks at the bodies lay strewn across the region.
JING-KLAT
It’s been an honour to fight 
alongside you.
Oof and Jing-Klat take a moment to hug one another.
A rumble from the Walkers, and loud BLASTS.
The F-FIGHTERS shoot at the Walkers from the side, flanking 
the behemoths.
The closest Walker goes up in flames, a leg falls off and it 
crashes.
The Walker behind is knocked down like a domino.
The gravity pulls it down to the ground hard.
From the sky, a huge green light comes down and hits the 
walkers.
They explode.
The F-Fighters shoot the debris as they pull up to the hole.
Poe drops out of his ship and hops into the hole.
67.
OOF
Captain?
Poe sees Oof and Jing-Klat standing there.
JING-KLAT
You came for us?
Poe removes his helmet.
POE
Resistance fights together.
Poe holds out his hand and pulls the two up towards the 
hole’s exit.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
POE (V.O.)
The First Order is down. We have 
two survivors.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
We have survivors?
POE (V.O.)
Confirmed.
The bridge team celebrate like it’s Apollo Thirteen’s finale.
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE
Domhnall takes a sip of space coffee then spits as the last 
green dot on his screen disappears.
DOMHNALL
No! No, no no no no.
RAVIOLI MANCARATTCHI
Sir?
DOMHNALL
Not now, not ever.
Domhnall walks out of the bridge, into the halls.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Laura Dern and Leia look at one another.
68.
LAURA DERN
What’s going on with the signal, 
someone?
ERNESTO MAGDA VOCATCHA
We’ve lost inter-system 
communications. Nothing outside 
this planet now.
LEIA
What happened?
The Resistance look at one another.
ERNESTO MAGDA VOCATCHA
Sabotage.
EXT. VANAGARA
The F-Fighters begin their ascent.
INT. F-FIGHTER COCKPIT SEVEN
Poe sits in the cockpit, he looks over to the ground.
POE
Hey BB8, you seeing that?
EXT. VANAGARA
Between the smoke and walker remnants, there’s another hole 
in the planet.
The F-Fighter points a light on the hole and hovers over it.
INT. VANGARA CAVE
The F-Fighter sinks its feeler in, a blue scanning light 
looks around.
We see what looks like a barracks, with First Order markings 
around.
POE (V.O.)
They built inside another planet?
BB8 (V.O.)
Bleep whistle bleep.
69.
INT. F-FIGHTER SHIP
Oof and Jing-Klat look at one another.
OOF
They must have terraformed.
JING-KLAT
The salt.
INT. STAR DESTROYER DOMHNALL'S RESIDENCE
Domhnall stares at a button on a desk.
DOMHNALL
Here goes nothing.
Domhnall smashes the button hard.
EXT. SPACE
An explosion on one side of Vangara.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Red Seven, you need to get off the 
planet, fast.
INT. VANGARA CAVE
The feeler lifts out of the cave as the roof begins to cave 
in.
EXT. VANAGARA
The planet quakes.
Poe’s F-Fighter fights the pull as it fails to get too far 
off ground.
From a distance, salt and soil fly in the air then get sucked 
back down hard.
The ground begins to crack and collapse.
70.
INT. F-FIGHTER COCKPIT SEVEN
Poe grabs his stick hard and pulls.
POE
Come on, you beautiful beast.
BB8
Whistle beep bleep.
POE
All power to the engines.
BB8
Bleep.
POE
We don’t need shields unless we get 
off this planet fast.
EXT. VANAGARA
The F-Fighter begins to get pulled into the ground.
A BLAST of engine pushes the ship up, and it fights through 
as the ground around collapses.
EXT. SPACE
The F-Fighter escapes the planet as it simultaneously 
explodes and implodes.
INT. F-FIGHTER COCKPIT SEVEN
Poe turn around to BB8 and laughs.
POE
Good job, pal. How about next time 
you drive?
BB8
Bleep whistle beep.
POE
You get a day off as soon as I 
become in charge.
They fly off away from the space debris.
71.
INT. EXPRAXIS CASINO ROYALE - DAY BUT LOOKS LIKE NIGHT
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang and Finn walk through 
a doorway, two TWILEK greeters nod and smile at them, they 
place HOLOLEI on the two customers.
Finn’s eyes widen and jaw drops.
The sound explodes to life with the noise and hubbub of 
gambling, singing, laughing, drunken stupors, anything Reno 
or Atlantic City might be but about 500 times bigger.
FINN
Oh my days.
Finn nods his head and walks across the grand casino.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang follows, looking high 
and low as she does.
FINN (CONT’D)
I know we’re on a super secret 
important cool mission but you 
think we could...
Finn mimes popping a coin and pulling a lever, then splashing 
coins in his face.
John Boyega makes it work.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
She’s not gonna be in the main 
halls. Santha works the 
entertainment rooms.
Finn looks to Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang.
FINN
Ohohohoo.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
No.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang slaps Finn’s arm.
The two walk past a Sabak table where two players lay cards 
down.
A DEALER looks over the cards.
DEALER
Three gleblorgs, house wins.
72.
The two players gargle in anger, one is placed in chains and 
walked away, the other takes out a blaster, we cut before...
INT. EXPRAXIS CASINO ROYALE ROULETTE
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang walk over to 
a path edge with railings, beyond the two is a giant spinning 
roulette wheel.
A gigantic ball drops.
CASINO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Final bets please.
The duo watch this giant ball bounce around. A few people 
hover over, flapping wings, trying to push the ball into 
various directions.
It is like Rocket League with Watto. Watto League. Coming to 
PSP this holiday season.
Through the commotion we hear the gentle hums of a song the 
soundtrack will list as ‘GLABON NANGTO THRAN’
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
You hear that?
CASINO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Red Four, folks. Red four.
Finn shakes his head.
FINN
That’s three fours in a row. This 
place is rigged.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
That voice, singing.
Finn turns around. He nods.
FINN
Yeah. Wait... Is that?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Maybe.
The dynamic duo bolt from the wheel-balcony and through the 
casino.
73.
INT. CASINO PERFORMANCE LOUNGE
SANTHA, early 20s, stands on stage. She’s probably played by 
a notable instagram influencer with a decent voice. A lessexpensive Zendaya.
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang walk into the 
lounge, and are immediately handed oversized cocktail 
glasses, with large Shrimp-like creatures in them.
The two sit down and watch.
The two shrimp-beings open their eyes and sway along to the 
song in the glasses.
The glasses are quickly placed on a table and pushed aside.
As the song finishes, Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy 
Bang Bang join in on a gentle applause.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang heads over to the 
stage.
Finn walks with her, but looks around the room.
We suddenly see a few First Order uniformed officials walking 
through the Lounge, and out to another place.
Finn begins to wander in that direction.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Finn?
Finn looks over, Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang waves 
Finn over.
FINN
One second, yeah?
Finn hops off, on the scent of the First Order.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang and Santha run towards 
one another and have a huge hug.
Finn leans out of the room.
INT. EXPRAXIS CASINO ROYALE
From Finn’s POV we see three First Order officials walking 
quickly towards the back of the gigantic casino, before a 
swarm of gamblers walk around and make them seemingly 
disappear.
74.
Finn begins to follow.
INT. CASINO PERFORMANCE LOUNGE
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang and Santha embrace 
still.
SANTHA
I can’t believe you’re here. In the 
flesh.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
You’re much taller than I remember.
They unembrace.
SANTHA
And you’ve barely changed. Why are 
you here?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
We had to see how bad things are, 
with the First Order.
SANTHA
We?
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks around.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
He was here a minute ago.
SANTHA
(Cheekily)
He?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
No.
(Laughing)
No.
EXT. EXPRAXIS CASINO BACK ALLEY
Finn opens a door, the blast of noise and light from the 
casino break through until the door shuts, and all is silent.
Before him, shadows and piles of rubbish, a few drunk aliens 
and holo-posters for upcoming performances.
Finn walks down the alley.
75.
FIRST ORDER GUY (O.S.)
He’s late.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH (O.S.)
He’s always where he needs to be, 
when he needs to be. Hold your 
tongue.
Finn stops and looks further down.
We see the three First Order suits standing with a heavy 
creature, VANCIBALD Grantuth, with five heads on rather long 
necks, each one floating around, saying a word a head.
FIRST ORDER GIRL
We can’t be standing around like 
this.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
This is Expraxis, you’re only seen 
here when you wanna be seem. Don’t 
worry.
FIRST ORDER THIRD WHEEL
I do worry, if General Domhnall 
doesn’t get the go ahead soon, 
he’ll...
BENECIO DEL TORO (O.S.)
He’ll what?
Benecio Del Toro walks out of shadows and into the 
conversation.
Finn in the back remains staring, hidden for the most part.
BENECIO DEL TORO (CONT’D)
Run off to another planet? How many 
others are so hidden from the 
Resistance?
Benecio Del Toro walks right up the First Order trio.
BENECIO DEL TORO (CONT’D)
You need me. Me? I can live without 
you lot, we do very well, and we do 
it very very well.
One of the First Order team nods and puts their hand up.
Behind Finn, a squad of Stormtroopers march in.
BENECIO DEL TORO (CONT’D)
What is this? A coup?
76.
One of the Stormtroopers hands over a datapad to Benecio Del 
Toro.
FIRST ORDER GIRL
I trust this will give us something 
to talk about.
Benecio Del Toro looks at the pad and smiles.
BENECIO DEL TORO
Ahh, finally we’re speaking the 
same language. Tell your general 
we’re good to go.
Benecio Del Toro begins to walk away.
BENECIO DEL TORO (CONT’D)
Oh, and for free I’ll give you a 
heads up, we’re not alone here.
Benecio Del Toro playfully points over to Finn.
A light blares down on him.
Everyone turns to look.
Finn slowly stands up.
FINN
Oh, hey there. You seen a cocktail 
waitress this tall, long blue hair, 
tail, three eyes? She said to meet 
out back.
The Stormtroopers begin to open fire.
FINN (CONT’D)
Ok, cool, bye.
Finn turns tail and runs down the alley.
Laser shots blast towards him, every single one missing of 
course.
FIRST ORDER GUY
Well, follow that man.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
That won’t cause a commotion.
FIRST ORDER THIRD WHEEL
Got any other ideas?
77.
Vancibald nods, a group of winged aliens fly down from the 
sky and begin to chase.
Finn runs and scrambles to open the door to the casino as 
shots blare.
The troopers are gaining on him.
The aliens are flying in.
The door isn’t opening.
FINN
Come on, please don’t do this.
He keeps grabbing.
The shots keep coming.
The aliens are closing in.
The door swings open.
A SERVER DROID walks out holding a bin bag.
A shot cuts through, the rubbish falls on the floor.
Various creatures run out of the bag and towards the aliens, 
biting at them.
SERVER DROID
Why I oughtta!
Finn taps the droid on the shoulder.
FINN
You’re the best droid I’ve ever 
met.
Finn runs into the casino.
The door closes behind him.
The Server Droid looks out as Stormtroopers and aliens gather 
round, trying to get into the door.
SERVER DROID
Ahh dang it, I’m gettin’
reprogrammed ain’t I’s?
INT. EXPRAXIS CASINO ROYALE
Finn darts through various gamblers, a crowd blocks him off.
78.
There’s only one free spot.
A row of slot machines.
Finn rushes down there.
The Aliens and Stormtroopers come into the Casino, holding 
the Server Droid’s arm.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
Search the area, rapido.
The forces disperse and wander the casino floor.
Finn hides behind the long row of machines, looking behind 
him, no exit, just a wall.
Stormtroopers walk around. Passing the Lounge, we see Kelly 
Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang and Santha still talking.
Slowly an aging DURO wanders down the row and sits at a 
machine.
FINN
Hey, shoo!
The Duro looks over to Finn, then back at the machine.
FINN (CONT’D)
Please, go.
The Duro slowly lifts his hand up in a ‘yeah yeah’ fashion.
Two flying aliens perch high above, looking around the casino 
floor like living cameras.
The creature places a single coin in the machine.
Finn looks back and gets between the final machine and the 
wall, slowly scooting up the machine.
The Duro pulls the lever down.
The First Order team wanders across the floor, pushing 
customers out of the way.
DING.
DING.
DING!
A huge amount of light and noise breaks out from the machine.
79.
The Duro gasps and jigs.
Money falls out.
Eyes turn to the machine from all over.
The sky.
The ground.
Everyone rushes over.
The Duro swipes at folk as it grabs the coins.
Finn shakes as he moves further up the machine.
It wobbles.
Finn reaches the top and stands up.
FINN (CONT’D)
Aha!
Everyone is suddenly looking up at Finn, including the aliens 
and Stormtroopers.
FINN (CONT’D)
Oh no.
Guns raise towards him.
Finn leaps at the wall and pushes the machine hard, it begins 
to tumble.
As it does, it begins to light and make noise.
Coins rush out.
And it hits the next machine.
More noise, lights, coins.
Finn begins to run on the machines as they fall.
A tracking shot as Troopers fire towards him, he runs and 
dodges, money, noise, lights, crowds.
Finn gets to the final machine, the aliens grab him as the 
machine comes crashing down on one Stormtrooper.
FINN (CONT’D)
Get off me.
Finn elbows one of the aliens, it buzzes off.
80.
The other can’t hold on, and the two fall to the ground.
Finn rolls and runs.
INT. CASINO PERFORMANCE LOUNGE
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang and Santha are in 
their own conversation.
SANTHA
How long are you staying here?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Erm...
Finn runs through.
FINN
We gotta go. Now.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks at Santha and 
shrugs.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
I love you.
She begins to chase Finn.
Santha waves.
Stormtroopers come rushing past.
Then two flying aliens.
Then the First Order trio.
Finally Vancibald. He stops, clutching his chest and 
breathing hard through three of his mouths.
He looks to Santha.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
How’s it going?
Santha nods.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH (CONT’D)
Good, good.
Vancibald joins the run again.
81.
INT. EXPRAXIS CASINO ROYALE ROULETTE
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang run, then 
stop.
Up ahead, Stormtroopers turn and look.
They turn around, more troopers running.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
What do we do?
Finn smiles.
FINN
Always bet on black.
Finn grabs Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang’s hand and 
begins running to the stormtroopers waiting.
They ready guns.
FIRE
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang jump as the 
blasts come to them, grabbing onto WATTO, who looks down and 
gives them a fist wave.
He flies them over the troopers and they let go, landing on 
the roulette wheel itself. Black 13.
CASINO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Final bets.
The Stormtroopers gather at the edge and look over, guns 
ready once more.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks to Finn.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Of all the ways to go out, this is 
furthest from anything I imagined.
FINN
That means it’s not how this story 
ends. Look up.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks up.
The elbowed alien buzzes around, and flies right into the 
Stormtroopers, a spare.
Some troopers fall over the balconey and onto the wheel.
82.
Things begin to shake.
CASINO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
And here comes the ball.
The wheel begins to spin.
Troopers start standing up on the wheel.
Others up above.
They fire down, missing as Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From 
Comedy Bang Bang move around.
FINN
I’ve flown through hyperspace but 
this... this might make me sick.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang rubs Finn’s back.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
We don’t have time for your stomach 
woes.
From high above, the giant boulder of a ball begins to fall 
towards them.
FINN
Oh no.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
We can’t be here too long.
The wheel keeps spinning. The faces of troopers come back 
again.
The two run the opposite direction, ending up running on the 
spot.
Troopers begin to run over on the wheel.
The ball bounces and knocks some of them down.
Everyone turns tail and runs away from the ball, spinning 
around the wheel for many rotations.
Vancibald looks at the First Order gang.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
Somebody please shoot them.
We see the Stormtroopers high above moving their rifles 
around trying to aim, and getting dizzy.
83.
Vancibald pushes them out of the way.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH (CONT’D)
Bah!
Vancibald takes out a thermal detonator.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH (CONT’D)
Amateurs.
Vancibald throws the detonator.
It flies towards the wheel, bounding on the ball.
We follow the detonator as it is picked up by one of the 
betting aliens flying past.
It is grabbed by another, who laughs and looks down.
The alien shrieks and drops it.
Another alien grabs it before it touches the ground, then 
laughs and begins to throw it to another alien, when the ball 
hits it.
The detonator falls, and lands at the feet of a Stormtrooper.
They look down, pick it up, then look up to Vancibald.
BOOM
A hole in the wheel.
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang run past the 
hole, look down and jump in.
Troopers follow.
The ball lands on the hole, and stops moving.
CASINO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Erm, This is... Erm.... House wins.
Everyone boos and throws rubbish at the wheel.
INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang dust 
themselves off and keep running, the troopers try and collect 
themselves, falling over one-another’s armour.
Our heroic duo head deep into darkness, until a blaster shot 
rings past them, and off to the distance.
84.
The far distance.
Hitting a wall. The flashing light on impact shows something 
of an early build barracks.
More shots fire, Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang 
Bang roll out of the way.
We see in clearer light for a moment, First Order markings on 
the walls, but nothing much else yet.
Structural integrity looks a little ropey, a few metal 
pillars.
Our heroes are at the edge of a small walkway, behind them 
the Troopers, in front of them a large drop down to the inprogress room.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
What is that?
Finn looks down, then at the Troopers.
FINN
A bad idea all round, come on.
Finn grabs some dirt from the ground, his other hand holding 
on to Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang and begins to 
run off the side.
The troopers run to the edge and fire around the room.
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang duck and roll 
as they hit the ground.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
They have the higher ground.
FINN
You ever seen one of these guys 
shoot? Come on.
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang duck and 
weave as they run across the room, to a pathway.
The troopers fire, one of them nudges another trooper and 
accidentally pushes them down.
The other trooper looks to the pusher, the pusher shrugs.
85.
INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN HALLWAY
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang turn to this 
small hallway, and stop.
In front of them, three Geonosians, lit by a single space 
light, play dice.
They turn to look at our heroes.
FINN
Hey there. Erm...
Finn straightens himself up and walks towards the insectoids.
FINN (CONT’D)
Just checking the safety, all good. 
Any of you wanna show me how the 
exit works?
The Geonosians look to one another, then back at Finn.
They all point down the corridor.
FINN (CONT’D)
Thank you. Take the day off.
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang head away.
The Geonosians shrug and keep playing.
EXT. EXPRAXIS GARBAGE DUMP
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang walk out a 
small pipeline and fall onto piles of garbage.
Above them, the casinos in full force.
FINN
Of course this whole thing winds up 
here.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
This planet is madness. Let’s just 
get my sister and head out.
Finn shakes his head.
FINN
We can’t go back in there alone.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
What?
86.
FINN
If the First Order have so many 
forces stationed here, we need to 
even the odds.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
You have an idea, or are you just 
shouting into the wind?
Finn takes out the space-tissue Poe wrote on.
FINN
I’ve got just the thing.
INT. KYLO'S SPACESHIP - SPACE NIGHT
Kylo sits, mask off, staring at the visualised audio from the 
Resistance base.
His lightsaber floats in front of him, it carves notches into 
the wall next to a worrying amount already.
Captain Phasma enters.
PHASMA
Master Ren, permission to speak 
freely?
KYLO
Go ahead Captain.
Phasma spends the time trying to stand in front of Kylo to 
get his attention, this will not be happening.
The saber still scrawls.
PHASMA
There are things I’m prepared to do 
for the order, my men are prepared 
to do for the order.
KYLO
Good, loyalty is important.
PHASMA
That’s not what I’m... We don’t 
kill innocent children.
KYLO
No?
PHASMA
I don’t...
87.
KYLO
Captain, you’ve slaughtered many. 
Men, women, elders.
PHASMA
But not...
KYLO
Not right in front of you. Out of 
sight, out of mind, Captain?
PHASMA
Not everyone has to die.
Kylo smiles.
KYLO
I heard stories of one who found 
the cure for death. Stories mind. 
We all succumb to it in the end.
PHASMA
If you’re going to take charge of 
my men, you...
KYLO
I? Best give the orders? As I 
outrank you deeply, Captain. 
Remember that.
Phasma looks around, then back to Kylo.
PHASMA
I will be informing the General 
about this.
KYLO
I look forward to seeing his 
whimpering hand place a medal on my 
armour, Captain.
PHASMA
Eugh.
Kylo finally looks to Phasma.
KYLO
In war, we all do terrible things 
for the right reasons. Learn to 
live with it, or find yourself a 
new position Captain. That’ll be 
all.
We move to the lightsaber, and match cut to:
88.
INT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK - DAY
Luke’s lightsaber sitting on a rock.
Pulling out, we reveal Rey unconscious, lying on the ground.
Luke and R2D2 sit around as Rey comes to.
LUKE
Good morning princess.
Luke reveals a firepit in the shack, and scoops up a bowl of 
something, placing it to Rey’s head.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Drink up, it’s all natural.
Rey looks at the bowl. There’s a few plants and a floating 
beak in the mix.
REY
Is that a...
LUKE
Porg? Annoying little creatures, 
but they don’t taste too bad.
Luke fills a bowl for himself and sips up.
Rey looks over to the lightsaber.
Luke sees her glance.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Your determination is commendable, 
but facing the wrong direction, it 
seems.
Luke sips again, Rey takes a sip too.
LUKE (CONT’D)
You’ve used it.
REY
What?
LUKE
The weapon. Yes?
REY
Kinda.
Luke nods.
89.
LUKE
Of course, and you realised it 
wasn’t simply one to pick up and 
point. Is that why you need me?
REY
No. Gosh, no. The galaxy, General 
Organa, Han...
Luke nods.
LUKE
The darkness spreads as it always 
has. Fighting only serves to 
destroy more.
REY
So you’d rather run, hide?
LUKE
Survive. In peace.
Rey looks around the shabby hole Luke calls home.
REY
And as the galaxy cries out for 
help, this is where their hero will 
be?
LUKE
You can’t bait me to irrationality, 
whatever happens out there, among 
the stars, is no longer my 
business.
Rey stands up.
REY
Very well.
Rey begins to walk off, she looks to R2D2.
REY (CONT’D)
Come on Artoo.
Rey opens the door. R2D2 begins to wheel over.
LUKE
Forgetting something?
Luke picks up the lightsaber and throws it to Rey.
Rey puts her hand out to catch it.
90.
A small blast comes from her palm, the saber flies back, 
hitting Luke in the forehead.
Luke topples over, then gets back to his feet, a red mark on 
his brow.
LUKE (CONT’D)
You really need to use that better.
The lightsaber lifts up behind Luke. It floats towards Rey.
LUKE (CONT’D)
It’s not a push, it’s a touch.
Rey grabs the saber from mid-air.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Try it.
Rey holds her hand out, the saber begins to shake.
And shake harder.
And spins around above Rey’s hand.
The hilt flies off, towards Luke, who ducks this time.
REY
Sorry.
LUKE
I’ve learnt my lesson.
REY
It’s just that something... 
something inside me has always been 
there, but now it's awake and I 
need help.
The lightsaber lifts from behind Luke. It gently moves into 
the centre of the room.
LUKE
Take out your crystal, I suppose 
you deserve the most basic 
information for your troubles.
Luke grabs the saber and unscrews the hilt, taking out a blue 
Khyber crystal.
Rey rifles through her pockets before R2D2 opens a port and 
reveals the white crystal.
91.
Luke sits down and places the parts of the saber between 
himself and Rey, who sits following Luke.
Rey begins to reach for the pieces.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Hold.
Rey stops herself.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Before you take the pieces I ask 
you to understand them.
Luke points to the hilt.
LUKE (CONT’D)
This is the body, strong and 
stable, it can be used by anybody.
Luke holds his Khyber crystal.
LUKE (CONT’D)
The heart lives inside the body, it 
powers everything.
Luke puts the crystal back in.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Sometimes it fails, eventually is 
stops working.
Luke turns the blade on.
LUKE (CONT’D)
This is the spirit, the power of 
connection. It can protect or 
destroy based on the heart and 
body.
Luke turns the blade off and removes his crystal.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Before you do anything else, I want 
you to just hold the body.
Luke hands the hilt to Rey.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Get a feel, a sense.
Rey holds the hilt, no crystal inside, in front of her.
92.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Don’t fear it, accept it, 
understand it, believe in it.
Rey looks at the hilt, she moves it around her hand.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Now turn it on.
Rey reaches for her white crystal, Luke grabs her arm.
LUKE (CONT’D)
No.
REY
But, it doesn’t work without...
LUKE
The heart. Use yours. You can power 
anything if you truly try.
Rey looks at Luke. He closes his eyes and takes a long 
breath.
Rey closes her eyes, she inhales.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Don’t think about it.
(Beat)
Feel it.
Rey gasps and we have a pulse of light become
MONTAGE:
INT. SEPERATIST SHIP - SPACE NIGHT
A CU of the saber as it is used to kill COUNT DOOKU (DARTH
TYRANUS, remember him? Sir Christopher Lee was in a Star War)
We Force Perspective to:
EXT. MUSTAFAR - NIGHT
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN fighting atop a crumbling bit of 
scaffolding or whatever was going on at that planet.
A slash of the blade towards Obi-Wan and we pulse again to:
93.
INT. TATTOOINE HOUSE - DAY
Young Luke releases the blue blade before old Obi-Wan for the 
very first time.
INT. CLOUD CITY DUEL LOCATION - EVENING
Luke swings the blade towards DARTH VADER.
INT. CLOUD CITY DUEL FINAL LOCATION
Darth Vader slices Luke’s hand off, and the saber falls.
EXT. BESPIN WALKWAY - EVENING
The saber hilt lands on some boxes and rolls to the floor.
A few blaster shots fly past and the hilt gets a little 
dusty.
A young woman, JANZA, 19, grabs a box and trips on the hilt, 
she dusts it off and grabs it, running away as footsteps 
approach.
A force Pulse again to:
INT. CLOUD CITY BAR - DAY
Janza brushes past a few Stormtroopers and hugs a young man, 
TWETIFANI, 23, placing the hilt in his belt holster.
The stormtroopers turn, and the force blasts us to:
EXT. BESPIN SPACEPORT - NIGHT
Twetifani and Janza rush towards a ship, Janza now clearly 
pregnant.
Some blaster shots fly by.
Twetifani takes the lightsaber out and beginsn deflecting 
shots.
Janza watches and cries as Twetifani hits a button on a 
ship’s ramp.
Twetifani is attacked by hundreds of shots, he can’t deflect 
them all as the ship flies off.
94.
The saber turns off and falls to the ground.
A force pulse as the hilt is covered with dust and mud and 
wear-and-tear until a figure brushes it off.
MAZ KANATA picks it up and looks at the hilt.
A FORCE PULSE 
TO:
DARKNESS
Silence. And then a loud saber sound and a flash of light.
INT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK - DAY
Rey opens her eyes and we see the lightsaber in front of her, 
floating through the force, on and bright blue.
She looks over to Luke, a smile and surprise on her face.
REY
Did I...?
Luke has a small sense of astonishment across his beard.
LUKE
The crystal, you built it all 
without moving. Real connection. 
I’ve seen this raw strength once 
before, it didn't scare me enough 
then. It does now.
REY
I... saw my parents, my father, he 
died to save my mother, to save me.
LUKE
This saber only brings back painful 
memories.
REY
How can I use this weapon to 
protect?
Luke smiles.
LUKE
I can show you that.
95.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY
Rey stands where Luke was found, hilt in her hand.
Luke stands a distance away. R2D2 by his side. Cloak blowing 
in the wind.
LUKE
Close your eyes.
REY
What?
Luke closes his eyes.
LUKE
Close them, feel the force, find 
that sense.
Rey closes her eyes.
REY
Ok. How will I find it?
Luke picks up some stones, he looks at R2D2 and winks.
LUKE
I’m sure you’ll feel it somehow.
Luke tosses a stone at Rey, it misses her by a fiftieth of a 
parsec.
REY
Ah.
LUKE
Yes?
REY
No.
Luke throws another stone, it hits Rey in the arm.
REY (CONT’D)
Ow.
LUKE
Was that something?
REY
I’m not sure.
LUKE
Well, keep feeling out.
96.
Luke winds up his arm and throws a stone.
Rey waves the lightsaber in front of her head then turns it 
back off.
There’s no more stone in the air.
REY
I found it.
LUKE
Good. Keep your eyes closed, keep 
feeling it.
Luke looks around, he picks up a few more stones, then looks 
over and sees a large rock.
R2D2
Beep beep, whistle.
Luke looks at R2D2.
LUKE
I’m not going to throw that.
R2D2 stares at Luke.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Or force throw it.
R2D2 keeps Luke in check.
LUKE (CONT’D)
You’ve lost your sense of humor.
Rey swings the lightsaber again.
Luke turns around.
LUKE (CONT’D)
What happened?
Rey opens her eyes.
REY
I’m not sure.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Leia jolts out of her chair as we see engineers fiddling with 
desks and screens around her, using ‘space’ screwdrivers 
(Batteries sold separately).
97.
Laura Dern looks over to Leia.
LAURA DERN
What is it?
Leia looks over to a gaggle of Resistance soldiers wearing 
headphones.
LEIA
Something’s coming.
Laura Dern steps over to Leia’s side.
LAURA DERN
Anything spotted?
People shake heads.
Laura Dern looks to Leia, with a face that’s both sensitive 
and a little highfalutin, she’s a talented actress and can 
pull this off without any Oscars to her name for some reason.
LAURA DERN (CONT’D)
Until something pops on their 
radar, General, we’re a-ok. You can 
rest up if you’re feeling a little 
out of place.
LEIA
Rest up?
Laura Dern offers a half-honest glance of care.
LAURA DERN
You seem a little distracted.
A couple of Resistance soldiers walk over to the two leaders, 
Laura Dern nods and steps back as they surround Leia.
LEIA
What are you doing?
LAURA DERN
I’m relieving you of complete 
command, General Organa. You’re in 
no shape to serve the Resistance 
currently. You’re confined to your 
quarters, General.
Members of the Resistance look over. Nobody gets up.
LEIA
You can’t...
98.
Laura Dern leans in to Leia’s airspace.
LAURA DERN
(Whispering)
This isn’t personal.
The soldiers walk Leia out of the room.
Laura Dern turns to face the eavesdropping Resistance 
members.
LAURA DERN (CONT’D)
Right, back to the job at hand.
We close in on the broken communication visuals.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
And pull out on this side.
Resustus and his pilots move their big ship around, we see 
stars pivoting in the screen before them. No longer facing 
the remnants of Vangara.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Just take us back to base.
Poe hops into the bridge.
POE
Belay that order.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Dameron. You’re not leading any 
more troops.
Oof and Jing-Klatt walk in, Porkins Junior and Demadre 
Olglanthine follow suit with BB-8 to boot.
DEMADRE OLAGLANTHINE
I’ll follow Poe to the ends of the 
universe.
JING-KLAT
Seconded.
OOF
Hear hear!
PORKINS JUNIOR
Also me.
99.
BB8
Clinky noise waffle.
Resustus looks at the soldiers amassing on his bridge.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
What is this, mutiny?
POE
You almost killed every member of 
the Resistance, you spineless, 
thoughtless ignoramus.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
What?
The soldiers gather up around Poe, the pilots hang back, 
leaving Resustus in the middle of his own isolated bridge.
POE
These soldiers have no confidence 
in your leadership.
Resustus steps up to Poe.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
Don’t you do it Dameron, know your 
place.
Porkins slaps cuffs on Resusts.
PORKINS JUNIOR
His place is here. To the brig is 
yours.
Porkins pushes Resustus past Poe.
RESUSTUS WAGATITO
When the comms come back, you’re 
gonna be in serious trouble, 
Dameron. They will line ALL OF YOU 
up!
Soldiers push Resustus through the bridge and laugh him out 
of the room.
Everyone turns to Poe.
JING-KLAT
So what now, Captain?
Poe looks at the space in front of them.
100.
POE
We have to bring the fight to them. 
Wherever they are.
Some cheers, before people realise it’s pure rhetoric.
SUDDENLY out of Hyperspace the Millenium Falcon appears.
POE (CONT’D)
Is that...?
Soldiers rush to the windshield.
OOF
The Millenium Falcon.
DEMADRE OLAGLANTHINE
Who’s flying her?
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang sit in their 
seats.
Finn hits a button, throws on a headset.
FINN
This is the Millenium Falcon, come 
in Resistance Flagship.
POE (O.S.)
Finn?
Finn’s eyes light up, a smile across his face.
FINN
Poe?
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang sees this reaction, 
that’s it, she knows there’s no chance for her.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
Poe and the others huddle by the communication console, Poe 
has a huge smile too.
POE
What are you doing in that?
FINN (O.S.)
Covert spy mission, like I do.
101.
Poe laughs and shakes his head.
POE
Well you missed the battle.
FINN (O.S.)
I found the war.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP HANGAR - MOMENTS LATER
A door opens and Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang 
Bang walk into the spaceship, where soldiers hang around (It 
is a Hang-ar)
Finn rushes to Poe and Rey-Leia hug it out.
FINN
Hey, this is Kelly. She’s a great 
pilot.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Hi.
POE
Not as good as me though.
FINN
Last time I flew with you we 
crashed.
Poe and Finn lock eyes, who’ll break first?
Poe smiles.
POE
I missed you. So, what do you got?
FINN
How does walking into the First 
Order’s base and giving them an 
almighty thrashing sound?
Poe turns to the Resistance.
POE
We are the spark that will light 
the fire that will burn the First 
Order down.
Cheering and hand raising and huge uprising happens.
102.
EXT. SPACE
From the Resistance Spaceship flies dozens, if not hundreds, 
of smaller ships, all forming up to head off.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Finn and Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang sit in their 
ship, they look over to a X-Wing.
Poe and BB-8 look over, smiling.
A musical sting as they Hyperspace out into nothing.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY
Rey opens her eyes, looks down, she’s balancing on one foot 
atop a small pillar.
Luke, below, sits down, eating something green.
A few Porgs waddle over, aiming at the food.
LUKE
Are you tired yet?
REY
Why do I need to do this?
Luke flicks away a Porg.
LUKE
A jedi must understand the balance 
of the universe. How one tiny 
movement can affect everything.
REY
What kind of movement?
Luke throws his food at Rey, two Porgs flap wings and fly 
into Rey.
She’s flailing, wobbling.
REY (CONT’D)
You’re mad.
Luke nods.
Rey hops on to her other foot and steadies.
103.
LUKE
And you’re following me. Who’s 
truly mad?
Luke sits up and walks to the pillar.
LUKE (CONT’D)
This is missing something.
Luke reveals his lightsaber hilt.
LUKE (CONT’D)
It’s easy to find balance when you 
see a strike coming.
Luke unsheathes the light blade.
LUKE (CONT’D)
But when you’re caught between a 
rock and a hard place.
Luke picks up a Porg in the other hand. This is getting dark. 
Luke IS mad.
REY
Put that creature down.
LUKE
Make me, Rey.
Rey watches Luke slowly swing the blade about, the Porg
looking a little scared but mostly gormless cute marketable.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Ok then.
Luke swings the blade towards the Porg.
A CU on Luke’s face.
On the Porg’s face.
Then Rey, closing her eyes, wincing.
The blade swings to the Porg and stops JUST AT ITS FACE!
The blade moves away.
Luke watches one of his hands move from the other, he has no 
control.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Yes.
104.
Luke is lifted from the floor, the blade removed from his 
hand, and the Porg from the other.
They both fly towards Rey, she catches the hilt, turning the 
blade towards Luke, and grabs the Porg with her other arm.
Rey opens her eyes, still balanced on the rock, now face-toface with Luke, in mid-air.
LUKE (CONT’D)
There’s a jedi.
Rey puts the blade away and pets the Porg.
REY
How do we get down?
LUKE
Gently.
Rey takes a step off the pillar, she’s now floating.
The two begin to descend.
Luke smiles at Rey and takes out another piece of food, 
handing it to the Porg.
LUKE (CONT’D)
You’ve surprised me. I’ve not seen 
this come so naturally to another 
person.
(Beat)
Well, one other.
Rey looks at Luke.
REY
Ren?
LUKE
Ben.
REY
Ren.
LUKE
Ben. With a B.
REY
Tall, angry, bad hair, all black?
LUKE
That’s my nephew you’re talking 
about. And yes.
105.
REY
He’s the worst.
Luke shakes his head.
LUKE
He’s bad at being bad. But what 
potential he had.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK
Luke and Rey, Porg in her hand, walk towards Luke’s hideaway.
REY
What happened with Ren and you?
Luke reaches for the door of his shack then stops.
LUKE
You know. Don’t make me say it.
REY
How do I know?
Luke looks to Rey.
LUKE
Come on, I’m not that bad a 
teacher. Anymore. Look inwards.
Rey closes her eyes.
LUKE (CONT’D)
See anything?
Rey shakes her head.
Luke sighs.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Ok then.
Luke walks off, Rey opens her eyes and looks around.
Luke comes back.
LUKE (CONT’D)
In your own time.
Luke wanders off once more, Rey in tow.
106.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - WOODS - EVENING
The sun begins to set as Luke and Rey wander through the 
woods.
REY
You can just tell me if it’s too 
much trouble.
LUKE
Nice try, I’m never talking about 
him again. Up ahead.
We look forward with Rey, and through the trees we see a 
large collection of rocks.
REY
Is this the original temple?
LUKE
Temple?
EXT. IRISH PLANET - ROCK FORMATION
Luke and Rey stop walking at the foot of this grand rock 
formation.
REY
Where’s the entrance?
LUKE
To what?
REY
The jedi temple.
Luke shakes his head.
LUKE
There’s nothing here, Rey. No 
ancestry, no legacy, no war. Just 
me. And...
Luke closes his eyes.
The rocks shake and begin to rise, splitting into smaller 
rocks.
Underneath, a rusting X-Wing is revealed, hidden inside.
The rocks move to one side.
Luke begins to sweat, his nose runs blood.
107.
REY
How long has this been here?
Luke drops to the ground, catching his breath.
LUKE
Since I landed.
(Beat)
Since I hid.
Rey walks over to the X-Wing.
REY
At least you didn’t destroy it.
Luke gets to his feet.
LUKE
I couldn’t, I tried, but I 
couldn’t.
Rey reaches towards the fighter and places her hand on it.
She gasps.
We FORCE PULSE out of the shot in the fancy way we saw 
earlier (Remember that? Search for it, it’s been a fair few 
pages. How are you doing? Got a coffee, a nice snack, there’s 
still a long way to go. I’ll wait, go and prepare yourself, 
it’d be a dick move to unpause until you’re ready. Also, 
airplane mode, please, don’t tweet, who cares if the country 
is collapsing, the story comes first. Ok, so, Force Pulse)
EXT. YAVIN IV - DAWN
It’s early on Yavin IV, amidst a jungle temple we see Luke 
(Slightly younger, beard styled, hip motherflipper) walking 
across a path as Kylo turns round, topless, gif-able here.
In the background, a few transport ships and Luke’s X-Wing 
sit, ready to be used.
KYLO
Uncle?
Luke stops, looks to Kylo.
LUKE
Try again.
KYLO
Sorry, Master Skywalker.
108.
Luke nods. Kylo throws on a shirt.
KYLO (CONT’D)
How about a quick duel, before the 
younglings wake?
Luke turns away.
LUKE
Will you stop it, Ben.
Kylo picks up his heels and follows Luke, they wander through 
the entrance of the temple.
INT. YAVIN IV TEMPLE
KYLO
I can’t train any further with 
these kids. You know I’m stronger 
than them all, I just need an 
opponent, a sparring partner.
Luke stops Kylo, a sliver of light from outside giving their 
outlines a glow.
LUKE
What you need is focus. Patience. 
Being a jedi isn’t about being the 
strongest, attacking anything that 
moves.
KYLO
I know there’s more to it, but 
without strength, how am I meant to 
fight?
LUKE
You’re not. You’re meant to defend.
KYLO
From what?
LUKE
Everything. This galaxy is full of 
danger, people need protection.
Kylo pushes Luke away, wandering into the darkness of the 
temple. His every movement echoes.
KYLO
I can’t fight, I can’t protect, I 
can’t push myself to be what I know 
I can be, what you know I can be.
109.
LUKE
What we both know you want to be.
KYLO
Is that it? You think I’m going to 
become him?
Luke walks to Kylo.
LUKE
It’s in our blood, Ben. It’s all 
around our selves. We can’t let the 
force take us, break us.
Kylo gets on his knees, closes his eyes.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Ben?
Kylo slowly takes his lightsaber hilt out, amidst the 
darkness.
KYLO
All my mom ever talked about was 
how strong you were, the greatest 
hero of the galaxy. I only ever 
wanted to be like you.
LUKE
Until you discovered Vader.
KYLO
It all made sense, Master.
Kylo unfurls his blade, yellow and stable.
LUKE
Ben?
KYLO
You can’t be at your strongest, at 
your best, without an enemy, to 
bring balance to your force.
Kylo stands.
Luke takes a step back.
LUKE
Don’t do something foolish.
KYLO
Fight me, Master, take us both to 
our best.
110.
Luke steps further back.
LUKE
Ben. You have a choice, you can 
stop this.
Kylo shakes his head.
KYLO
You won’t let me be everything I 
can be, what kind of teacher are 
you?
Kylo swings his blade towards Luke. Luke pushes Kylo back 
with a force push.
LUKE
Caring, compassionate, I’m family.
KYLO
So was he.
Kylo swings again, Luke smashes his green blade out and 
deflects Kylo’s swing.
Kylo stumbles back.
KYLO (CONT’D)
Here we go.
LUKE
Don’t get excited.
Kylo swings once more for Luke, Luke force-stops Kylo midswing.
LUKE (CONT’D)
I am so disappointed in you.
KYLO
And I you, master.
Luke swings his blade into the hilt of Kylo’s, and shatters 
his lightsaber.
The power of the hit trembles the temple, some debris falls.
KYLO (CONT’D)
My blade!
LUKE
A jedi doesn’t need a weapon to be 
powerful.
111.
KYLO
A real warrior would kill his 
enemies before they can kill him.
Luke pushes Kylo down.
LUKE
Anyone who kills another behind 
their back is weak.
KYLO
Then take me now, before I take 
you.
LUKE
This is not going to go the way you 
think.
Luke stares at Kylo.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Your mother would be ashamed.
Luke walks away.
KYLO
Hey, Master, we’re not done here.
LUKE
I am.
Luke disappears into the glow of the outside.
Kylo lays on the ground of the temple, he laughs and cries in 
a weird double.
The temple begins to shake.
EXT. YAVIN IV
Luke walks away from the temple, towards a small camp, we see 
some young kids waking up, bowing to Luke.
A rock flies at Luke, hitting him in the head.
Luke turns around, as other kids look beyond Luke, faces 
dropping.
Kylo walks, dragging large rocks behind him with the force.
Behind him, the temple begins to collapse.
112.
KYLO
Master Skywalker, you’re right. I 
don’t need a lightsaber to be 
strong.
Kylo begins throwing massive rocks towards Luke and the 
children.
Luke pushes them, but Kylo forces stronger and stronger.
LUKE
Stop it, right now.
KYLO
Make me.
Kylo throws more giant rocks, Luke falls to the ground as he 
pushes the rocks from the children.
Some of the children try to help push the rocks.
Luke’s lightsaber begins to lift away from him.
LUKE
No.
It flies to Kylo.
KYLO
For all your talk, Master, it’s 
disappointing to see how strong you 
really are.
Luke falls as more rocks fly. Kylo pushes the rocks onto Luke 
and walks towards him, blade open.
The kids take out mini-blades, but Kylo pushes them back, and 
kneels over Luke’s body, looking into Luke’s eyes.
KYLO (CONT’D)
I’m not going to kill you, that 
would destroy my mom. But I’m going 
to make you watch, as I bring true 
balance to the force, to the 
galaxy. As I show you my power.
LUKE
Don’t you dare, don’t you dare, you 
can stop this.
KYLO
Yes, but you can’t, can you?
113.
We close in on Luke, as he struggles with the rocks on him, 
looking on.
We hear children yell and scream, as blades whizz and smash.
And we FORCE PUSH out and back to...
EXT. IRISH PLANET - ROCK FORMATION - EVENING
Rey pulls herself away from the X-Wing.
REY
The children.
Luke nods.
LUKE
He wanted to be the last jedi.
REY
But he left you alive.
LUKE
I wasn’t going to put up any more 
fight after that. He knew my 
weakness.
REY
Compassion.
LUKE
Nothing more dangerous in this 
world than someone who doesn’t 
care. Who just wants anarchy.
REY
Then how can we stop him?
Luke looks around for a moment.
LUKE
He cares about one thing.
REY
Power?
LUKE
Balance. When he finds someone 
worthy, he’ll lose focus on 
everything else.
REY
Someone like you?
114.
LUKE
Someone like you.
Rey shakes her head.
REY
No, I’m not ready, I’m not that 
strong.
LUKE
Maybe not, but you’ve got drive, 
spirit, a fight. It’ll work in a 
pinch.
EXT. SPACE
Kylo’s ship flies through space, it’s a cool shot.
INT. KYLO'S SPACESHIP
Kylo sits, mask in hand, looking out to space.
LUKE (V.O.)
I hope.
Captain Phasma walks into view, behind Kylo.
PHASMA
We’re approaching the source, 
shouldn’t we deploy shields and 
stealth?
Kylo doesn’t turn, keeps looking out.
KYLO
This is a fight, Captain, we’re not 
sneaking in from the back. There’s 
no honor in that.
Kylo puts his mask on.
PHASMA
You’re taking all of my men into an 
unwinnable battle.
KYLO
We’re showing force, dominance, 
isn’t that what you favor, Captain?
115.
PHASMA
I know what you’re up to here. I’m 
not wasting my men on a personal 
vendetta.
Kylo turns.
KYLO
Vendetta?
PHASMA
You’re fooling nobody.
Kylo unfurls his blade.
KYLO
I’m following my orders, and you 
should too.
PHASMA
If you intend to use that on me, I 
suggest you choose a more suitable 
environment.
Phasma reveals her phasma-stick.
KYLO
This isn’t about her, Captain.
PHASMA
Whatever it is about, I refuse to 
give you my men.
Kylo swings for Phasma, Phasma knocks the blade away with a 
quick flick of her stick.
PHASMA (CONT’D)
Any fool can strike...
Phasma flicks the stick again, the hilt falls from Kylo’s 
hand.
PHASMA (CONT’D)
Vader knew that all too well.
Phasma takes Kylo’s mask off, he’s red-faced and weeping.
Phasma shakes her head.
PHASMA (CONT’D)
I’m not stopping you following your 
orders. Good luck, Ren.
Phasma turns and walks out of the room.
116.
Kylo grabs his hilt, unfurls his blade, and swings towards a 
wall, yelling.
INT. KYLO'S SPACESHIP - COCKPIT
Phasma walks over to the two pilots, as a few Stormtroopers
stand around.
PHASMA
Change of plans, we’re heading back 
to Expraxis, there’s plenty of work 
to do there.
A buzz on the ship’s computer, one of the pilots, HAGGATHEEDO 
Manazapani, looks over.
HAGGATHEEDO
Someone’s launching a fighter.
PHASMA
Master Ren’s going on a mission, 
let him leave.
Haggatheedo clicks a button.
EXT. SPACE
Kylo’s ship opens up, and a small FIGHTER flies out of the 
ship.
Kylo piloting, fixes his mask in the cockpit.
The main ship flies into hyperspace.
EXT. SPACE PLATFORM
A CU of a ship coming to ground, steam and hydraulics spewing 
out against the blackness.
We pull out.
INT. STAR DESTROYER DOMHNALL'S RESIDENCE - SPACE NIGHT
This is actually an iron on a shirt, mechanical and shiplike. We make a joke out of this, because people said this 
happens on twitter.
Domhnall paces in his room.
A BEEP on an intercom.
117.
PHASMA (O.S.)
General Domhnall, this is Captain 
Phasma, I’ve escorted my men back 
to Expraxis to assist First Order 
infiltration.
Domhnall rushes to press an intercom button, he’s sweating.
DOMHNALL
What happened to Ren?
PHASMA (O.S.)
He’s... doing what he does best.
Domhnall sweats harder.
DOMHNALL
Of course he is. Stooge.
INT. KYLO'S STARFIGHTER
Kylo sits in the cockpit, flying through space as the stars 
seem to move in the distance.
The Resistance planet comes closer in the distance, Kylo 
locks eyes with it and flicks a switch in the cockpit.
Two blue proton torpedoes fly from the fighter.
KYLO
Let’s see how good your shields 
are.
Kylo flies towards the planet, blue streams from the 
torpedoes begin to evaporate as Kylo’s ship flies through 
them.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
A huge red alarm on a comms machine.
ERNESTO MAGDA VOCATCHA
We’ve got incoming.
People begin to run around, some folk grab weapons, Laura 
Dern looks around.
LAURA DERN
What’s going on?
ERNESTO MAGDA VOCATCHA
Brace for impact.
118.
LAURA DERN
From what?
Ernesto looks at the screen, he turns to Laura Dern and 
points at the red.
ERNESTO MAGDA VOCATCHA
At that!
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE
We see a moment of serenity outside the base, nature rolling 
beyond the lens.
A flurry of blue hits, and shakes through, debris, crashing, 
light, noise, a cacophony, something a director would inform 
the special effects team to compose, that sounds great in 
Atmos too, guys.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
The room shakes, rubble falls from the ceiling.
Laura Dern stands as others fall to the ground.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - HALLWAY
Two troopers outside Leia’s room shudder, a few troops run 
past, they follow.
Leia pops her head out, then exits the room proper, with 
C3P0, Chewbacca and Chewbacca’s Porg follow.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE
We see troops amass amidst the destruction, rockets, snipers, 
all looking around.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Leia and gang rush into the room, Laura Dern looks over.
LAURA DERN
Get back to your quarters.
A bit of ceiling falls by Laura Dern’s head.
LEIA
What is going on here?
119.
LAURA DERN
Everything is under control.
Ernesto stands up, dusts himself off, and looks at the comms
screen.
ERNESTO MAGDA VOCATCHA
Erm, what’s that?
A red blur flies across the screen, then back again, then 
bounces up and down.
LAURA DERN
Someone’s jamming our system.
Leia shakes for a moment.
LEIA
That’s no jammer.
CHEWBACCA
Raaaaawr.
C3PO
We appear to be being raided by a 
sith lord.
Chewbacca grabs his Porg and pets it.
CHEWBACCA
Raaaawr!
C3P0 pats Chewbacca gently.
Leia closes her eyes.
WE FORCE ZOOM 
TO:
INT. KYLO'S STARFIGHTER
Kylo, determined, zooms towards the planet.
He suddenly slows, his mask slips off, and his eyes widen.
KYLO
No.
Kylo grabs his mask and puts it back on, the ship hurtles 
towards the planet.
As it closes in, we start to see the base from above.
120.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE
Rockets shoot up, snipers take aim, a lot of firing in one 
direction.
INT. KYLO'S STARFIGHTER
Kylo grabs the trigger on his driving stick.
ECU: Clutching the button, the trigger of the ship is pulled.
EXT. RESISTANCE BASE
From above a slew of large blaster fire crashes onto the 
resistance fighters, they fall and are flung around.
We look up.
There’s a puff of hydraulics from the starship and the ship 
comes crashing into the base.
Kylo lands, superhero landing, away from it, his mask nolonger on his face.
Kylo smiles.
WE FORCE PULL 
TO:
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Leia opens her eyes.
LEIA
He’s outside.
Laura Dern pushes a button, lights flash and alarms blare.
LAURA DERN
To arms!
EXT. IRISH PLANET - LUKE'S SHACK
Luke and Rey wander towards Luke’s shack.
LUKE
And you can use their bones for 
table legs too...
They stop and turn to one-another.
121.
REY
I felt it.
LUKE
Go. Training is complete.
REY
I’m not ready.
LUKE
The galaxy doesn’t wait for you. 
Trial by fire.
Rey shakes her head.
R2D2 pops out of the shack.
REY
You can do it. You’re the hero.
LUKE
I’m not a hero, I’m a coward. 
Happily so.
R2D2
Beep beep whistle.
LUKE
I... I can’t bare to see her in 
person.
REY
You’d put personal issues above 
restoring peace?
LUKE
I’ve already restored peace. I’ve 
done my part. I’ve fought my wars. 
Why can’t someone else do it?
REY
Because you’re the strongest.
LUKE
Not anymore.
(Beat)
Not anymore.
A moment of silence.
122.
REY
Fine. I’ll go and get myself killed 
and you can add me to your 
tormented memories in this isolated 
misery of a planet.
Rey barges past Luke.
R2D2
Beep beep.
R2D2 barges past as well.
LUKE
Hey artoo, you understand.
R2D2
Beep Whistle.
LUKE
I... I can’t.
R2D2 wheels over to Luke, pulls back and ‘kicks’ Luke’s shin.
LUKE (CONT’D)
Hey.
R2D2
Whistle.
LUKE
Really?
R2D2 nods on their legs.
LUKE (CONT’D)
I’m so gonna regret this.
Luke heads off to follow Rey, R2D2 trails.
EXT. IRISH PLANET - ROCK FORMATION
Rey cracks open the cockpit windscreen on the old X-Wing, 
dust flies around.
Luke wanders over, Rey looks to the old man.
LUKE
Don’t say a word.
Rey hops into the front seat, Luke looks at Rey, then shakes 
his head and hops in the back.
123.
R2D2 rolls on through and lifts into the droid space. The 
windshield comes back down.
LUKE (CONT’D)
It’s a little old, might be tough 
to control.
REY
I didn’t start flying yesterday, 
let me handle this, you keep 
General Organa safe.
Luke closes his eyes, the X-Wing whirls and begins to lift 
up.
WE FORCE PULL 
TO:
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Leia watches as all the troops run around.
Chewbacca places his hand on Leia’s shoulder, she looks over, 
and into Chewbacca’s eyes.
LEIA
Luke!
Chewbacca smiles, then looks over to his other hand, where 
the Porg is sitting, squawking.
Chewbacca tosses the Porg away and moves in front of Leia.
EXT. SPACE
The Resistance armada flies together across space.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
Finn looks over to Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang, 
who seems so into the flight, determined, strong.
FINN
Are you up for this?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
I’ve trained my whole life for this 
moment.
Finn nods.
124.
FINN
The First Order won’t know what hit 
them.
POE (O.S.)
(Over speakers)
Falcon, we’re reading a large ship 
orbiting the planet.
Finn grabs his communicator.
FINN
That’s their destroyer, they’ll be 
on high alert.
INT. RESISTANCE SPACESHIP BRIDGE
Poe stands overlooking the navigation window.
POE
How do we play this, we can’t hide 
our presence, there’s too many.
FINN (O.S.)
A few ships slingshot around the 
planet, until we’re below radar 
sighting, and the rest can send the 
First Order a message.
POE
Saying what?
FINN (O.S.)
You can run...
Poe smiles.
INT. MILLENIUM FALCON COCKPIT
FINN
But you can’t hide.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang smiles.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Make them all pay.
125.
EXT. SPACE
The Millenium Falcon and a few smaller starfighters exit the 
armada and move in an upward/left direction, as the rest 
continue on.
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE
Domhnall walks up the bridge, watching as Expraxis sits 
before them all.
RAVIOLI MANCARATTCHI
General, we’re getting a call.
Domhnall lets out a sigh.
DOMHNALL
Can’t have a minute to myself. Put 
it up.
On the window, the holo-visage of Benecio Del Toro appears.
BENECIO DEL TORO
General, glad I could catch you.
DOMHNALL
What can I do for you?
Benecio Del Toro smiles.
BENECIO DEL TORO
Well you could start by completing 
the deal, we’re three payments 
behind.
Domhnall shakes his head.
DOMHNALL
Payment arrives when your builders 
finish their job.
Benecio Del Toro nods.
BENECIO DEL TORO
That was the original deal, yes, 
but I’m altering it. You want your 
precious hideaway, I want my planet 
not to be full of war. It, er, 
isn’t a good look to the high 
rollers.
Domhnall’s face gets red.
126.
DOMHNALL
You shameless pig, you’d value 
greed over the good of the galaxy?
BENECIO DEL TORO
Very much. What do I care the 
outcome of your war? It all comes 
down to credits in the end, so 
either pay up now or lose your 
barracks.
Domhnall clutches a desk, hard. Imprints hard.
DOMHNALL
My people are down there right now, 
what’s stopping me giving the order 
to take you out completely?
Benecio Del Toro chuckles.
BENECIO DEL TORO
If you thought you could take this 
planet by force I wouldn’t be here 
talking to you. So, let’s just pay 
our debts and move on without any 
more fighting.
The holo-visage cuts out, the planet comes back into view.
Domhnall’s lip quivers.
DOMHNALL
Can we just shoot that man?
Ravioli shakes his head.
RAVIOLI MANCARATTCHI
The last time someone took aim at 
him, their entire species was 
eradicated in minutes.
DOMHNALL
Then what good is the First Order?
People look down at their devices and screens.
Domhnall screams.
EXT. EXPRAXIS GARBAGE DUMP - NIGHT
The neon of the casino in the background becomes hidden as 
the Resistance ships make their descent, landing just right 
off the dump.
127.
We see troops march out of the ships, Finn and Kelly Marie 
Tran From Comedy Bang Bang stand before them all, looking at 
their place of escape.
FINN
Ok folks, I think we made it pretty 
free and clear so far, let’s keep 
it that way. Single file, silent as 
possible. Follow me.
Finn leads the troops up the chute that he and Kelly Marie 
Tran From Comedy Bang Bang fell out of earlier, this time 
armed with grappling devices.
They all sling up and out of shot.
INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN HALLWAY
In the darkness, the troops head down the hallways of the 
cavern.
Finn looks to Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang.
FINN
(Hushed)
As soon as we secure this spot, you 
head out and find your sister.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang nods.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Are you coming with me?
Finn shakes his head.
FINN
They’ll spot me a mile off.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang nods and hugs Finn.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Thank you for all of this.
She kisses Finn’s cheek.
FINN
Oh, that’s... too kind, thanks.
They continue moving down the hall, now it’s awkward.
128.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE
Kylo walks down hallways, saber out, slicing up as troops 
come by the way.
He pushes folks with the force, pulls folk closer as he 
chops, and looks cool doing it.
Kylo stops at a door. Smoke billows from all places, and a 
laser shoots out.
Kylo stops the shot as the door begins to open.
Laura Dern heads out with two troopers. She aims her blaster 
at Kylo.
LAURA DERN
Pew, pew, pew!
Kylo spins his saber.
EXT. SPACE
The old X-Wing flies across space.
Luke sits in the back, eyes closed.
WE FORCE PULL 
TO:
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Chewbacca grabs a staff from the back wall, Leia takes out a 
blaster.
LEIA
He’s right outside, I can feel him.
CHEWBACCA
Raaaawwwr!
Leia pats Chewbacca.
LEIA
You can’t fight him, you’re not 
strong enough.
CHEWBACCA
Rawr.
Chewbacca looks at Leia.
129.
LEIA
How far away?
There’s a rumble and a troop flies across the room.
LEIA (CONT’D)
Not close enough.
Chewbacca rushes towards the doorway as Kylo bursts through.
LEIA (CONT’D)
Ben.
Kylo looks over to Leia.
KYLO
General.
Kylo looks over to Chewbacca.
KYLO (CONT’D)
I remember you.
Kylo puts his hand up at Chewbacca, Chewbacca steps back but 
isn’t pushed down.
EXT. SPACE
Luke in the back of the X-Wing shakes and shimmies.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Kylo looks at Chewbacca.

You... you’re not a wookie.
Chewbacca steps forward and swings his staff, Kylo dodges and 
swings back.
KYLO (CONT’D)
Ok then.
INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN
POV: We wander through the cavern, scuffling of trooper feet 
in the back sounds, it’s still dark.
JING-KLAT
Clear!
130.
OOF
Clear!
Troops fill out the cavern, someone kindly drops a light 
source and we see the barracks still unfinished.
The POV points to the ledge into the casino, a grapple 
launches and pulls us over there, turning to look down on all 
the troops.
Soldiers planting explosives all over the walls.
Finn looks over to the camera from down there.
FINN
Good luck.
The camera turns and heads into the darkness.
INT. CASINO PERFORMANCE LOUNGE
Santha walks onto the stage, people clap and choke down 
drinks.
SANTHA
Thank you.
Music begins to play, it’s a little classical but also 
upbeat, not exactly jizz music.
Santha begins to sing, it’s going to be the theme to the next 
sequence because that always works out well, and The Fifth 
Element deserves to be directly referenced in a lesser 
franchise.
INT. EXPRAXIS CASINO ROYALE
By a small section of slot machines and Sebulba-branded
pinball machines, a flap of carpet opens and Kelly Marie Tran 
From Comedy Bang Bang looks around like she’s a Teenage 
Mutant Ninja Turtle, before getting out of the floor and 
walking the casino.
She heads towards the performance lounge.
INT. CASINO PERFORMANCE LOUNGE
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks to Santha and 
smiles, Santha looks over and smiles back.
131.
Across the room we see Vancibald Grantuth watching the 
performance, his eyes follow the smile to Kelly Marie Tran 
From Comedy Bang Bang, conspicuous with a blaster on her 
person.
He begins to make his way across the room, when a tap on his 
shoulder.
Vancibald turns, Captain Phasma stands there.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang looks over and sees 
the movement, she ducks down.
PHASMA
You, pit boss, where’s the 
entrance?
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
What is wrong with you people? 
Where is your discretion?
PHASMA
I’ve got things to do, point and 
walk.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
Follow me.
Vancibald walks out of the room and into the casino proper, 
Phasma follows.
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE
Domhnall paces on the bridge, people work normally.
PHASMA (O.S.)
Make it quick General, I’m heading 
down.
DOMHNALL
If you run into that rat casino 
boss, do me a favour and blast him 
away, talks are running down.
PHASMA (O.S.)
Sir?
DOMHNALL
Those are my orders, if it has to 
be, leave no-one alive.
132.
RAVIOLI MANCARATTCHI
Sir, I’m picking up large numbers 
of moving bogies, heading straight 
for us.
DOMHNALL
What now?
PHASMA (O.S.)
What?
DOMHNALL
Close her down, clear the channel.
INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN
We see Resistance troops and Finn looking around as the last 
explosives are set, Finn looks up to the ledge, waiting.
EXT. SPACE
Rey flies the X-Wing, Luke shakes and suddenly stops, there’s 
a small burst of force in the cockpit, and the ship jolts up 
and down.

Chewbacca and Kylo trade swipes with their weapons, the staff 
stopping the lightsaber’s dangerous blade, but dealing no 
real damage.

armada heading towards it.

ships and leave the mothership.
133.
INT. CASINO PERFORMANCE LOUNGE
Santha sings, Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang slowly 
rises again to watch, she beckons Santha over, but Santha is 
still singing.
Santha looks to a ceiling, with a cool sci-fi security 
camera.
INT. EXPRAXIS CASINO ROYALE
Vancibald walks Phasma and a few stormtroopers across the 
casino floor and up some stairs.
INT. CASINO BOSS OFFICE
We see security feeds on a screen, including Santha singing, 
as a plush, gold-laden casino office reaches out, with 
privacy window overlooking the whole casino.
Benecio Del Toro sits there, lighting up a death stick.
Vancibald walks in, Phasma and the troopers follow.
The door closes, and two more heavies appear.
PHASMA
What is this?
Benecio Del Toro sits up and smiles.
BENECIO DEL TORO
Ah, so General Domhnall sent his 
right hand man, or woman. Are you 
collateral, or a different kind of 
payment?
Phasma walks towards Benecio, the heavies train on her.
PHASMA
This is hardly the welcome I was 
expecting, where’s our build?
Benecio Del Toro tuts.
BENECIO DEL TORO
You people, always with the 
business. Sit down, take a load 
off, have a deathstick.
Benecio opens a drawer, a trooper holds their blaster towards 
Benecio.
134.
BENECIO DEL TORO (CONT’D)
Hey, hey, woah.
Benecio slowly reveals a box of uncut, smoothly rolled 
deathsticks. He moves it towards Phasma.
BENECIO DEL TORO (CONT’D)
Enjoy. You need to remove that 
monstrosity of a helmet first, of 
course. Let’s see your pretty face.
Phasma picks up the box of deathsticks.
PHASMA
Flimsy.
She opens the box.
PHASMA (CONT’D)
And counterfeit.
Benecio smiles.
BENECIO DEL TORO
What is real and fake but in the 
eye of the beholder?
PHASMA
I don’t have time for games.
Benecio chuckles.
BENECIO DEL TORO
Then you’re on the wrong planet.
INT. EXPRAXIS CASINO ROYALE
The flap of floor opens again and Finn heads out, ducking and 
diving around the casino, until he reaches the performance 
lounge.
INT. CASINO PERFORMANCE LOUNGE
Finn sees Santha, Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang
appears behind him, having hidden in a corner.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
What are you doing? It’s not safe, 
you said.
135.
FINN
You’re taking too long, we don’t 
have much of a window. Grab your 
sister and run.
They look to Santha who finishes her song.
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Ok, now.
FINN
Good.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang rushes across the room 
as everyone claps.
Santha moves from the microphone, taking a drink from a cup.
SANTHA
You’re too kind.
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang hops on the stage and 
grabs Santha’s hand.
SANTHA (CONT’D)
What are you doing?
KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
Come with us, it’s not safe.
SANTHA
What?
We look to the camera in the ceiling.
INT. CASINO BOSS OFFICE
On the screen we see some commotion on the stage.
Benecio Del Toro looks over.
BENECIO DEL TORO
Vance?
Vancibald nods.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
On it, boss.
Vancibald rushes out.
Phasma looks over, we see Finn on one of the screens too.
136.
PHASMA
That imbecile.
BENECIO DEL TORO
Don’t worry, we have ways of 
dealing with problems.
PHASMA
So do we.
Phasma nods, the troopers throw down blaster fire across the 
room.
INT. EXPRAXIS CASINO ROYALE
Looking from the privacy glass above, we hear nothing and see 
minor flashes of light, as Vancibald rushes down some stairs 
and across the way.
INT. CASINO PERFORMANCE LOUNGE
Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang takes Santha off 
stage, Finn joins the rush out of the room.
INT. CASINO BOSS OFFICE
Phasma fires a few more rounds.
PHASMA
General, we have a problem, 
resistance fighters have 
infiltrated the planet.
Phasma leaves the room, the troopers follow.
EXT. STAR DESTROYER
We see the fleet of Resistance fighters swarming the 
destroyer, as First Order ships begin to rush out.
INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE
Domhnall is knocked to the side by a small explosion.
DOMHNALL
Why is everything happening at 
once? Who isn’t doing their job 
properly?
137.
Everyone on the bridge looks up to Domhnall.
DOMHNALL (CONT’D)
What are you doing? Kill something!
EXT. STAR DESTROYER
We see X-Wings, Y-Wings and B-Wings flying around the bottom 
of the destroyer, taking out the shield functions.
TIE Fighters follow these ships and fire towards them.
Fighters dodge these blasts, and we see the TIE fighters 
accidentally help take out the shield generator.
INT. POE'S X-WING COCKPIT

The old X-Wing lands and the cockpit flies open.
Rey hops out of the ship, Luke sits, eyes closed.
Rey rushes towards the base.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - HALLWAY

see Laura Dern’s body amidst the pile. It is mostly lit by 
the blaster shot still hovering in the air.
REY
Oh no.
INT. RESISTANCE BASE - BRIEFING ROOM
Kylo slices towards Chewbacca, Leia locks an aim with her 
blaster.
Kylo looks over to Leia.
138.
KYLO
Mom?
Leia lets out a gasp.
KYLO (CONT’D)
Mom? What are you doing? It’s me.
LEIA
No it’s not. This isn’t my son.
KYLO
I am, you’re my mom, you’ve always 
been my mom.
Leia shakes her head.
LEIA
My son wouldn’t do this.
Leia shoots the blaster, Kylo puts his hand out, stopping the 
shot.
KYLO
You stupid old fool.
Kylo swipes the staff in half, Chewbacca tumbles to the 
ground.
Kylo takes a step towards Leia.
KYLO (CONT’D)
You, Dad, Uncle Luke, all you ever 
wanted to do was stop me becoming 
who I was born to be.
LEIA
You were born to be loved, to be 
part of our family.
KYLO
I AM part of the family. I am my 
grandfather’s grandson.
Leia shakes her head.
LEIA
He was lost, alone, led down a bad 
path. You, you had everything. You 
were meant to be good.
139.
KYLO
I am good. I’m better than good. 
I’m the best in the galaxy. I wish 
you believed in me.
Kylo walks closer, the blast moves with him.
LEIA
Is this what you wanted? Kill 
enough people and I’d join you?
Kylo shakes his head.
KYLO
I don’t want you to join me. I’ve 
found my path now, mother. And 
there’s no space for you.
Rey rushes in.
REY
Put her down.
Kylo stops and smiles.
KYLO
A wrinkle.
Kylo turns.
REY
Let the general go.
Rey takes out her blade.
Kylo’s eyes widen.
KYLO
You, I owe you a scar.
Kylo drops the blast, it breaks a wire and the lighting in 
the room flickers.
Rey swings her blade around a few times, Kylo tries to 
prepare.
Chewbacca suddenly lunges onto Kylo and knocks the blade from 
his hand.
Rey rushes to Leia.
LEIA
Rey?
140.
REY
I found him, I found Luke. He’s 
here.
LEIA
Here?
REY
We need to get you out of here.
Leia looks over at Kylo, pushing Chewbacca off of him.
LEIA
What about...
REY
I’ll deal with him.
Kylo force-grabs his blade.
KYLO
I’ve had enough of you, you were 
never Dad’s favorite.
Kylo moves to swing at Chewbacca.
The blade stops.
LUKE (O.S.)
Han loved him more than you could 
ever know.
Luke walks into the room, hand holding up the blade, forcestyle.
C3PO is also in the background, he’s just there.
KYLO
Uncle Luke?
LEIA
Luke?
CHEWBACCA
Raawr?
Luke pushes Kylo back.
REY
General, go, now.
Leia looks at Luke, and Kylo, her whole life, here.
141.
Chewbacca picks up Leia, C3PO joins them, Rey holds the blade 
out to protect them.
LUKE
Is this all you ever want to do? 
Kill?
Kylo tries to move.
Chewbacca shepherds Leia and C3PO out of the room.
KYLO
Just let me go, let me fulfill my 
destiny.
LUKE
Destiny? What do you know about 
destiny? You weren’t born to kill, 
you weren’t born to save, you were 
just born.
Luke forces Rey’s blade from her hand.
KYLO
What are you doing?
LUKE
And I wish you never were.
REY
Luke?
Luke swings the blade at Kylo.
Kylo smiles.
He breaks out of the hold and blocks Luke’s swing.
LUKE
What?
Kylo swings again, Luke blocks it.
KYLO
You think you can hide away for 
decades and still be the strongest 
jedi?
Kylo hits a few times, Luke is knocked back. Rey looks for an 
entrance to the fight.
142.
KYLO (CONT’D)
All it took to finally make you 
fight me, as ever, is endangering 
people you love.
Kylo swings more at Luke, who blocks, defends.
KYLO (CONT’D)
If you truly loved me, you would 
have brought me to my full 
potential.
Kylo swings further, Luke is struggling to defend.
KYLO (CONT’D)
Now you’re just a weak...
Swing
KYLO (CONT’D)
Old...
Swing
KYLO (CONT’D)
Man...
Swing!
The blade drops from Luke’s graps.
REY
Luke.
KYLO
You’re no hero. Not anymore.
Kylo swings, Rey reaches out, Luke closes his eyes.

Give me back my star.
Vancibald stands above all the troops, holding a blaster.
The troops all point blasters at this man.

SANTHA
You promised me the galaxy.
Santha reaches for Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang’s 
blaster.

You said I’d be the biggest star in 
the sky.
Santha aims at Vancibald.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
I still believe it, you’re the 
best.
SANTHA
I am?
Santha gets a little shaky with her shot.
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
Of course, I wanted everyone to 
hear you, to see you, I always do.
Santha puts her gun down.
SANTHA
Vance!
VANCIBALD GRANTUTH
Santha!
Santha leaves Kelly Marie Tran From Comedy Bang Bang’s grip 
and runs towards the ledge.
Vancibald is suddenly riddled with blaster fire.
His body flops down, to Santha’s feet.
Phasma and the stormtroopers (Showing Tuesdays on the main 
stage) appear.
144.
PHASMA
FN 2187, stop your foolishness at 
once.
Finn looks at Phasma, they have the lower hand.
FINN
Why don’t you come down here and 
say that.
PHASMA
Shoot them all.
The troopers open fire, the Resistance fire back, there’s a 
lot of lights flashing, running around.
We see troopers fall as Phasma leaps down, taking out her 
staff.
Finn shoots towards her, Phasma rushes to Finn.

You!
Santha stands, looking at Vancibald’s body.

ground and grabs a blaster, she grabs Santha and tries to 
escape, Santha shakes her sister off.

He gave me all I ever dreamt of in 
this galaxy.

KELLY MARIE TRAN FROM COMEDY BANG BANG
There’s so many places you can 
perform in this galaxy.
SANTHA
I’m going to be a fugitive.

Well, it’s better than being dead.

Sorry.

Mancarattchi. Congratulations,

Why do you ruin everything you 
touch? We should have thrown you 
away at birth.

Good news, I’m not your problem 
anymore.
Finn joins up with some of the Resistance.

Sounds are reverberating. There’s nothing to see but drips of 
water are heard, footsteps, murky voices.
INT. RED ROOM
Rey awakens, her hands and feet caught, no movement going on.
Kylo bows to Snoke, who sits on his throne.
SNOKE
Very good young padawan. You have 
rid this galaxy of its jedi problem 
forever.
KYLO
Master, is it possible for the sith
to grow their power without jedi?
SNOKE
You talk of balance?
KYLO
Yes.
151.
SNOKE
That is a jedi myth, they wish to 
create harmony in the universe, 
they do not wish for unlimited 
power to dominate. They always 
feared what they could not control.
KYLO
And what do you fear, Master Snoke?
Snoke smiles.
SNOKE
A sith fears nothing.
Snoke looks over to Rey.
SNOKE (CONT’D)
Would you bring this jedi here for 
me to destroy? Finally, the last 
jedi shall be rid, by my hands?
REY
Let me go.
KYLO
I hoped to prove my worth to the 
sith, to you, in person.
Snoke nods.
SNOKE
Very well. Fulfill your destiny.
Snoke holds out his hand, revealing a new hilt. Kylo grabs 
the blade, unleashes it, there is no more flicker.
KYLO
You made this for me?
SNOKE
A true sith deserves a perfect 
weapon.
Kylo smiles.
KYLO
Then this first use shall be one 
for the ages.
Snoke nods.
Kylo turns to Rey.
152.
REY
Let me go, let me go!
Rey’s shackles move a bit.
SNOKE
She’s powerful.
Kylo nods.
KYLO
More than you?
Snoke shakes his head.
SNOKE
There is none more powerful.
Kylo smiles, he throws his new lightsaber at Snoke, it stabs 
the man in the chest.
SNOKE (CONT’D)
Ren, what....
Kylo walks over to Snoke.
KYLO
This old generation, they sit in 
power, force those with more 
strength, more thought, to do their 
bidding. And what do we get in 
return?
Kylo takes the blade out of Snoke.
SNOKE
Why?
KYLO
Ultimate power, it is a balancing 
act.
Kylo breaks Rey’s shackles, Rey looks over.
Snoke dies.
KYLO (CONT’D)
I’m through taking orders. Come 
with me, together we can restore 
the force in this galaxy.
Kylo takes out Luke’s lightsaber, holding it out to Rey.
Rey looks at the hilt in shock.
153.
