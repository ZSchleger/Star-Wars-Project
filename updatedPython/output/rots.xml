<setting>1 EXT. SPACE</setting>

<crawl>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.</crawl>

<sd>A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.</sd>

<crawl>War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere.

In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the <name type="NORP">Galactic</name> <name type="ORG">Senate</name>.

As the <name type="NORP">Separatist</name> <name type="ORG">Droid</name> Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi <name type="ORG">Knights</name> lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . .
</crawl>

<sd><name type="ORG">PAN</name> DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to <name type="ORG">PAN</name> with the Cruiser as TWO <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with <name type="ORG">the Jedi Fighters</name> as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.</sd>

<setting>2 INT. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.</sd>

<setting>3 INT. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>NS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Look out, four droids inbound . . .</sp>

<setting>4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name></setting>

<sd>The TWO <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.</sd>

<setting>5 INT. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> struggles to maintain control of his ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> We've got to split them up.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Anakin, they're all over me!</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N swoops in for the kill. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DES.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I copy, Artoo.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I'm going down on the deck.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name>SHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Hurry up! I don't like this!</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a <name type="ORG">Battleship</name>. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro <name type="ORG">Droid</name>, ARFOUR.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (continuing) Ouch!</sp>

<sd>R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> We're locked on ... we've got him . . .</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find <name type="FAC">the Command Ship</name> and get on with it ...</sp>

<sd>R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>'s ship is directly ahead.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.</sp>

<setting>6 INT. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.</sp>

<sd>Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> STARFIGHTERS.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Come on, Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL:</speaker> (OS) Copy, Red Leader.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .</sp>

<setting>7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL:</speaker> We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.</sp>

<sd>The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.</sd>

<setting>8 INT. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture <name type="ORG">Droid</name>s straight ahead, coming down the left side.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I'm going head to head. See you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Take it easy, Anakin.</sp>

<sd>Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL:</speaker> I'm on your right, Red Leader.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Incoming!!</sp>

<sd>ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Five more on the right!</sp>

<sd>Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> and ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Here we go.</sp>

<sd>The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DE.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I'm going high and right.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Hang on. There are four more of them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.</sp>

<sd>In one incredible move, ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N swings in behind the DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.</sd>

<sd>ARTOO lets out a <name type="GPE">HOWL</name> as ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N accelerates past the last DROID <name type="ORG">TRI</name>-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N looks behind him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Anakin, you have four on your tail.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I know. I know!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Four more closing from your left.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I know. I know!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Break right and go high.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I'm going low and left.</sp>

<sd>Obi-Wan shakes his head.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (to himself) He still has much to learn.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name>SHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>, BLASTING four of them away. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name> <name type="ORG">Battleship</name>s. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS nervously.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Use the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, think yourself through, the ship will follow.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Wrong thought, Artoo.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) I'm through.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the <name type="ORG">EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name><name type="ORG">SIO</name>N</name>.
A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.
Finally, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL:</speaker> There are too many of them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE PILOT 2:</speaker> I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I'm going to go help them out!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for <name type="FAC">the Command Ship</name>!</sp>

<sd>Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Missiles! Pull up!</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> They overshot us . . .</sp>

<sd>The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan�s Fighter and EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the <name type="ORG">Starfighter</name> rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> They're coming around!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> We got 'em. Artoo!</sp>

<sd>Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Flying is for droids.</sp>

<sd>Suddenly, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name> Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZ<name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I see them . . . Buzz <name type="ORG">Droid</name>s.</sp>

<sd>The BUZZ <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> break into the wiring. One of <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> goes after ARFOUR.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .</sp>

<sd>ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> The mission. Get to <name type="FAC">the Command Ship</name>. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> crawling over Obi-Wan�s <name type="ORG">Starfighter</name>. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (continuing) In the name of ...</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Steady . . . steady . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Move to the right.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I'm not leaving without you, Master.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N moves his ship next to OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'s and tries to physically knock <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'s ship in the process. One of <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view.</sd>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N knocks off three of <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights <name type="ORG">the BUZZ</name> DROID.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Yeah, you got him!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Great, Artoo.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Stay on my wing . . . <name type="ORG">the General</name>'s Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Have you noticed the shields are still up?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Oh?!? Sorry, Master.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N streaks ahead of OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>'s disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DES.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.</sp>

<setting>9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>The shield door drops away, and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a <name type="ORG">FANTA</name>IL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts <name type="ORG">SLAM</name>MING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.</sd>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors <name type="ORG">SLAM</name> shut.
OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name>DES. <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> rush at him from all directions.</sd>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> to where OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Artoo, locate the Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Tap into the ship's computers.</sp>

<sd>They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> fight off FOUR MORE <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a <name type="ORG">HOLOGRAM of</name> the Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name> ship appears.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I sense <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I sense a trap.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Next move?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Spring the trap.</sp>

<sd>The <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> start to leave; ARTOO follows. The <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> stop and turn to ARTOO.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Here, take this, and wait for orders.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> tosses the comlink to ARTOO.</sd>

<setting>10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name> enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO <name type="ORG">B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARDS</name>. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the <name type="ORG">NEIMOIDIAN</name> CAPTAIN.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>:</speaker> What's the situation, Captain?</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN:</speaker> TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>:</speaker> Just as <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku predicted.</sp>

<setting>11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>'s <name type="ORG">B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARDS</name> confront the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD I:</speaker> General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.</sp>

<sd>As a dozen more droids join the group, the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Anakin. . .</sp>

<setting>12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>The TWO <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge <name type="ORG">EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name><name type="ORG">SIO</name>N</name>S outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Well then, we're safe for the time being.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.</sp>

<sd>They run, <name type="ORG">EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name><name type="ORG">SIO</name>N</name>S rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF <name type="FAC">SHIELD</name> DOORS CLOSING AND LOC<name type="GPE">KI</name>NG ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPAR<name type="GPE">KI</name>NG excess power dischargers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> They're sealing this section off.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Six droids coming our way!</sp>

<sd>The last of <name type="ORG">the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING</name> in the distance.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.</sp>

<sd>They move along a wall. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPAR<name type="GPE">KI</name>NG dischargers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> We'll never get through that. It's too small!</sp>

<sd>They move toward a second vent. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> disables the SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.</sd>

<sd>The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I found our escape vent.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> swim closer.</sd>

<sd>As the SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.</sd>

<sd>The two <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>.

At the far end sits <name type="ORG">SUPREME CHANCELLOR</name> PALPATINE. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> move toward the CHANCELLOR.
As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (bows) Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Are you all right?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (quietly) <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku.</sp>

The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.</sp>

ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> move up the stairs.

OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>. COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> holds OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> in the air using the <name type="ORG">Force</name> as he turns and kicks ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N out of frame. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is choking.
ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N hits the archway.
<name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> sends OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> spins around again and, using the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N spins and kicks COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name>, sending him over the balcony. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N Jumps, following him down to the main floor.

<sp><speaker>COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name>:</speaker> (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you don�t use them.</sp>

<sd>Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT <name type="ORG">DOOKU</name> as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.</sp>

<sd>PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.</sp>

<sd>The ship begins to list to one side. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N rushes over to OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N still carrying OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.</sd>

<setting>53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> regains consciousness and tries to look around.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Did I miss something?</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>NN:</speaker> Hold on.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> What is that?</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> and ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> turns to ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N.</sd>

<sd>They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.
ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.</sd>

<sd>As the <name type="ORG">Federation</name> Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.</sd>

<setting>57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of <name type="GPE">Coruscant</name>. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> None of those ships will get us anywhere.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I agree.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> What are we going to do?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I don't know.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Don't look at me. I don't know.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and PALPATINE both look to OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.</sd>

<setting>58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>, blowing them up. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and PALPATINE follow OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and <name type="ORG">EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name><name type="ORG">SIO</name>N</name>S as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.</sd>

<setting>59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and PALPATINE are out of breath.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N/OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Well, that was close.</sp>

<sd>They laugh.</sd>

<setting>60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sp><speaker>B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD:</speaker> General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>:</speaker> Activate ray shields.</sp>

<setting>61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Ray shields!</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You're the Master. I'm just a hero.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I'm open to suggestions here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Why don't we let them take us to <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>. Perhaps with <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.</sp>

<sd>The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I say . . . patience.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Patience! That's your plan, is it?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .</sp>

<sd>ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) See! No problem.</sp>

<sd>Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>. <name type="ORG">SIXTEEN SUPER</name> <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> emerge from behind the DESTROYER <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>.
ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> who then kicks ARTOO over.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SUPER <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> DROID:</speaker> Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Do you have a plan B?</sp>

<setting>62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>. They stand before the ALIEN DROID <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>:</speaker> Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.</sp>

<sd>A <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> DROID walks to <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name> and hands him the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name>'S lightsabers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> That depends upon your point of view. Hah!</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>:</speaker> And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>:</speaker> Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Not this time. And this time you won't escape.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Artoo.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.
OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, yanks his lightsaber out of <name type="ORG">the General</name>'s hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds.

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N uses the <name type="ORG">Force</name> to yank his lightsaber out of <name type="ORG">the General</name>'s hand.</sd>

<sd>The <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> and ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> and ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>'s TWO <name type="ORG">B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARDS</name>.</sd>

<sd>CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>. <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name> walks around the bridge directing the <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>.</sd>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> fights one of <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>'s <name type="ORG">B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARDS</name>. The B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.
OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD'S head. The DROID B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD keeps attacking. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD. He cuts the DROID B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD in half. TWO <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> try to take the CHANCELLOR away.
ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.
OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> finishes off the headless B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.
ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT:</speaker> Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>:</speaker> Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> and ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N destroy the remaining <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>. <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name> retrieves one of the B<name type="ORG">ODY</name>GUARD'S staffs and faces OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>.

OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.</sd>

ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> cut through the rest of the <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> as if they were made of butter.

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Yes, thanks to your two Jedi <name type="ORG">Knights</name>. They killed <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku, but <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name> has escaped once again.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name> will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> That maybe true, but with <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku dead, he is the leader of the <name type="ORG">Droid</name> Army, and I assure you, the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> Then the Jedi <name type="ORG">Council</name> will make finding Grievous our highest priority.</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">BAIL</name>, ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> Building Grand Hallway.</sd>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N and <name type="ORG">BAIL</name> ORGANA, walking in the hallway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the <name type="NORP">Separatist</name>s, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO and <name type="ORG">THREEPIO</name> follow behind the crowd.</sd>

<sp><speaker>C-3PO:</speaker> It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO beeps.</sd>

<sp><speaker>C-3PO:</speaker> (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with <name type="ORG">BAIL</name> ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> ORGANA:</speaker> The end of <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name> is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.</sp>

<sd>Behind a row of large columns, a <name type="ORG">SHADOWY</name> <name type="ORG">FIGURE</name> follows the <name type="FAC">JEDI</name> and the SENATOR. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N senses the figure.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> ORGANA:</speaker> I'll do everything I can with the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Excuse me.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> ORGANA:</speaker> Certainly.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N stops, and <name type="ORG">BAIL</name> goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the <name type="ORG">SHADOWY</name> <name type="ORG">FIGURE</name>, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Wait, not here . . .</sp>

<sd>He grabs her again.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N embraces her, then looks at her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I'm just excited to see you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Nothing . . . nothing . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!</sp>

<sd>PADME begins to cry.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> . . . Is there someone else?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Something wonderful has happened.</sp>

<sd>They look at each other for a long moment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> That's . . . that's wonderful.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> What are we going to do?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Annie, I want to have our baby back home on <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You are so beautiful!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> It's only because I'm so in love . . .</sp>

ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Anakin??</sp>

PADME descends the stairs and joins ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> What's bothering you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Nothing . . .</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> It was a dream.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Bad?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> He's been a father to me, but he's still on the <name type="ORG">Council</name>. Don't tell him anything!</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the <name type="ORG">Force</name>. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi <name type="ORG">Council</name> <name type="ORG">MACE</name> WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, YODA, the <name type="GPE">HOLOGRAMS</name> of <name type="ORG">PLO</name> KOON and <name type="GPE">KI</name>-ADI-MUNDI.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker> Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the <name type="ORG">Council</name> as the Chancellor's personal representative.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> Allow this appointment lightly, the <name type="ORG">Council</name> does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I understand.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker> You are on this <name type="ORG">Council</name>, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.</sp>

<sd>Anakin reacts with anger.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the <name type="ORG">Council</name> and not be a Master?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker> Take a seat, young Skywalker.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Forgive me, Master.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. <name type="GPE">KI</name>-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.</sd>

<sp><speaker>Kl-ADI-MUNDI:</speaker> We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker> We cannot take ships from the front line.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.</sp>

<sp><speaker>Kl-ADI-MUNDI:</speaker> What about the droid attack on the <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>s?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker> It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker> Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> Go, I will. Good relations with the <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>s, I have.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker> It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>s on Kashyyyk. May the <name type="ORG">Force</name> be with us all.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N is disappointed.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the <name type="ORG">Council</name> and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the <name type="ORG">Council</name> at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The <name type="ORG">Council</name> doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the <name type="ORG">Council</name> . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> That has nothing to do with this.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You mean divided loyalties.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I warned you there was tension between the <name type="ORG">Council</name> and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> The <name type="ORG">Council</name> is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I hope so . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Anakin, the only reason the <name type="ORG">Council</name> has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> And?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> What situation?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (takes a deep breath) The <name type="ORG">Council</name> wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi <name type="ORG">Council</name> is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Why didn't the <name type="ORG">Council</name> give me this assignment when we were in session?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> This assignment is not to be on record. The <name type="ORG">Council</name> asked me to approach you on this personally.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Master, the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> demanded that he stay longer.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> The <name type="ORG">Council</name> is asking you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> :</speaker> Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker> It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker>I wish I did.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the <name type="ORG">Force</name>?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name>:</speaker> So the prophecy says.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> He will not let me down. He never has.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> I hope right you are. And now destroy the <name type="ORG">Droid</name> armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the <name type="ORG">Force</name> be with you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Thank you, Captain.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN <name type="ORG">TYPHO</name>:</speaker> Rest well. My Lady.</sp>

<sd>CAPTAIN <name type="ORG">TYPHO</name> gets back into the <name type="ORG">Speeder</name>, and it disappears into the cityscape. The HANDMAIDENS, <name type="ORG">Motee</name> and <name type="ORG">Elle</name>, approach PADME as the SHADOW OF A <name type="ORG">FIGURE</name> moves in the background. C-3PO is standing nearby.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I'll be up in a while.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MOTEE</name>:</speaker> Yes, my lady.</sp>

<sd>C-3PO stands, confused, as the HANDMAIDENS turn and exit.</sd>

<sp><speaker>C-3PO:</speaker> Is there anything I might do for you, my lady?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Yes, make sure all the security droids are working. Thank you, Threepio.</sp>

<sd>The golden droid turns and exits.</sd>

<sd>PADME stands and watches the sunset. The <name type="ORG">SHADOWY</name> <name type="ORG">FIGURE</name> moves toward her. She senses something.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Beautiful, isn't it?</sp>

<sd>PADME jumps and turns around.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> You startled me.</sp>

<sd>He sits next to her on the bench.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> How are you feeling?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> He keeps kicking.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> He?! Why do you think it's a boy?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> (laughs) My motherly intuition.</sp>

<sd>She puts his hand on her belly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl.</sp>

<sd>They laugh.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I may be on the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Anakin . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (suspicious) What do you mean?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a <name type="NORP">Separatist</name>!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> What is it?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Nothing.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.</sp>

<sd>They look in each other's eyes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.</sp>

<sd>PADME is startled at this.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I sense there are things you are not telling me.</sp>

<sd>PADME smiles. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N is a little embarrassed.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You wanted to see me, Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>. He is hiding in the <name type="ORG">Utapau</name> system.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I would worry about the collective wisdom of the <name type="ORG">Council</name> if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far � but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> They try.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi <name type="ORG">Council</name>. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I'm not sure I understand.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi <name type="ORG">Council</name> want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I don't think . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I know they don't trust you . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Or the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I don't know ... I don't know what to say.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> The Jedi use their power for good.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> . . . evil.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>. That is why they are more powerful.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> And the Jedi don't?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.</sp>

<sd>PALPATINE smiles.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I'm not sure it's wrong.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N is deep in thought.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> No.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the <name type="ORG">Force</name> to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> He could actually save people from death?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> The dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name> is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> What happened to him?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Is it possible to learn this power?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Not from a Jedi.</sp>

<setting>94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING</setting>

<sd>PADME and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> sit on one of the couches.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Has Anakin been to see you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi <name type="ORG">Council</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.</sp>

<sd>They laugh.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> You should be a Jedi, Padme.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> You're not very good at hiding your feelings.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Why would he talk to me about his work?</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> studies her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Don't give me that look.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I know how he feels about you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> (nervous) What did he say?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Nothing. He didn't have to.</sp>

<sd>PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I don't know what you're talking about.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him.</sp>

<sd>PADME looks down and doesn't answer.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .</sp>

<sd>They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the <name type="ORG">Council</name> about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Thank you, Obi-Wan.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> We cannot let this turn into another war.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> ORGANA:</speaker> Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MON</name> MOTHMA:</speaker> We are hoping to form an alliance in the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BANA BREEMU</name>:</speaker> That would be dangerous.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MON</name> MOTHMA:</speaker> We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.</sp>

<sp><speaker>GiDDEAN DA<name type="ORG">NU</name>:</speaker> Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">CHI EEKWAY</name>:</speaker> Patience, Senator.</sp>

<sp><speaker>FANG ZAR:</speaker> We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BANA BREEMU</name>:</speaker> When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BAIL</name> ORGANA:</speaker> Let us see what we can accomplish in the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>, before we include the Jedi.</sp>

<sd>PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You're going to need me on this one, Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> starts to turn and leave.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Master!</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> stops and ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N walks over to him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the <name type="ORG">Council</name>. Your friendship means everything to me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the <name type="ORG">Council</name> makes you a Jedi Master.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> starts down the ramp, then turns back.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of <name type="ORG">Utapau</name>. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Well, there's always a first time.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> laughs.</sd>

<sd>They talk for a few more minutes before ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N watches OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> depart.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Obi-Wan, may the <name type="ORG">Force</name> be with you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Good-bye, old friend. May the <name type="ORG">Force</name> be with you.</sp>

A hologram of the planet <name type="ORG">Utapau</name> is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>:</speaker> Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>:</speaker> Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?</sp>

<sd>They laugh.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> climbs into his Jedi Fighter.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>:</speaker> That was Anakin who was late. I believe.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> He will soon have Grievous's head.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> We can only hope the <name type="ORG">Council</name> didn't make a mistake.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> The <name type="ORG">Council</name> was very sure in its decision.</sp>

<sd>Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> There are rumors in the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Not fit? Why would anyone think that?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> That's ridiculous. Who?!?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> That's impossible. I would know.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N becomes worried.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) Idle <name type="ORG">Senate</name> gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> He came by this morning.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> He's worried about you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You told him about us, didn't you?</sp>

<sd>She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Obi-Wan and the <name type="ORG">Council</name> don't trust me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> You expect too much of yourself.</sp>

<sd>They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N puts his hand on her belly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I have found a way to save you.</sp>

He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRA<name type="ORG">GON</name>-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.
OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the <name type="ORG">Force</name> with his slight hand movements.</sd>

<sp><speaker>WRANGLER:</speaker> (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.</sp>

<sd>One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> walks along the line of DRA<name type="ORG">GON</name>/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> This one.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Your move.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>:</speaker> You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.</sp>

<sd>His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated <name type="ORG">Count</name> Dooku!</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the <name type="ORG">BATTLE</name> DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>'s hands. A loud <name type="ORG">EX<name type="ORG">PLO</name><name type="ORG">SIO</name>N</name> is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name> and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, <name type="ORG">CLONES</name> can be seen rappelling onto balconies.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>:</speaker> Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>, which includes PADME and five other Senators:</speaker> NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCOR<name type="GPE">KI</name>LL, and <name type="ORG">MON</name> CALAMARI. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N stands to one side of PALPATINE.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>FANGZAR:</speaker> But surely . . .</sp>

<sd>The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.</sp>

<sd>PADME gives ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> What do you mean?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> They are not to be trusted.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I'm sure you're mistaken.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.</sp>

<sd>PALPATINE studies ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N carefully and gives him a skeptical look.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>:</speaker> Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>, and we</sp>
have begun our attack.

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his</sp>
intentions.

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Yes, Master.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N leaves the room. COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>'s hologram disappears.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WINDU:</speaker> I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name> surrounds the Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker>Kl-ADI-MUNDI:</speaker> If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from</sp>
office.

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WiNDU:</speaker> That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi <name type="ORG">Council</name> would have to take control of the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>Kl-ADI-MUNDI:</speaker> . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.</sp>

<setting>118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING</setting>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N brings news to PALPATINE.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged <name type="ORG">General Grievous</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I should be there with him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> It is upsetting to me to see that the <name type="ORG">Council</name> doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the <name type="ORG">Council</name>. I know there are things about the <name type="ORG">Force</name> that they are not telling me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>.</sp>

<sd>They walk into the hallway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> How do you know the ways of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> My mentor taught me everything about the <name type="ORG">Force</name> . . . even the nature of the dark side.</sp>

<sd>They stop.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You know the dark side?!?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> What did you say?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You're a Sith Lord!</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N ignites his lightsaber.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi <name type="ORG">Council</name>! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You're wrong!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Are you going to kill me?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I would certainly like to.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE's throat. There is a tense moment, then ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I am going to turn you over to the Jedi <name type="ORG">Council</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I will quickly discover the truth of all this.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N stares at him for a moment.
PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name> lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan's LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up.

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>.</sd>

<sd>The <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan's LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.</sd>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> charges <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>, swinging the staff and hitting the <name type="ORG">Droid</name> in the stomach, knocking the gun away. <name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name> is hit by the staff, and the <name type="ORG">Force</name> bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat.

<sd><name type="ORG">GENERAL</name> <name type="ORG">GRIEVOUS</name>'s stomachplate is loose.

OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>. At the last second, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> reaches out his hand and uses the <name type="ORG">Force</name> to retrieve the <name type="ORG">Droid</name>'s laser pistol.</sd>

They fight over the precipice. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N arrives to see PALPATINE and <name type="ORG">MACE</name> fighting.</sd>

<sd>They stop as <name type="ORG">MACE</name> forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and <name type="ORG">MACE</name> start yelling at each other.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WINDU:</speaker> You are under arrest, My Lord.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> No! No! You will die!</sp>

<sd>PALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by <name type="ORG">MACE</name>'s lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> He is a traitor, Anakin.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> He's the traitor. Stop him!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> Don't listen to him, Anakin.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">MACE</name> pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine's hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">MACE</name> WlNDU:</speaker> He has too much control of the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> It is not the Jedi way . . .</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">MACE</name> raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> (continuing) He must live . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Please don't, please don't . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I need him . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Please don't . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> NO!!!</sp>

<sd>Just as <name type="ORG">MACE</name> is about to slash PALPATINE, ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N steps in and cuts off the Jedi's hand holding the lightsaber.</sd>

<sd>As <name type="ORG">MACE</name> stares at ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N in shock, PALPATINE springs to life.
The full force of Palpatine's powerful Bolts blasts <name type="ORG">MACE</name>. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Power! Unlimited power!</sp>

<sd>His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> What have I done?</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N sits.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I will do whatever you ask.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Good.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N kneels before PALPATINE.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Good. Good. The <name type="ORG">Force</name> is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> Thank you. my Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Rise, Darth Vader.</sp>

<sd>Palpatine moves over to his desk.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak:</speaker> he is now fully DARTH SIDIOUS.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Because the <name type="ORG">Council</name> did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I understand, Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the <name type="ORG">Jedi Temple</name>. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other <name type="NORP">Separatist</name> leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>:</speaker> Very good, sir.</sp>

<sd>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name> starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>:</speaker> (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.</sp>

<sd>He hands OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>:</speaker> Yes, sir!</sp>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.
The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name> (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the <name type="ORG">HOLOGRAM OF</name> DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> can been seen battling <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> on a landing platform.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DARTH SlDIOUS:</speaker> Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>:</speaker> It will be done, My Lord.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER C<name type="ORG">ODY</name>:</speaker> Blast him!</sp>

<sd>The battle rages all around OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>. <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> and <name type="ORG">CLONES</name> are everywhere. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name> as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him.
OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole.</sd>

<setting>133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN</setting>

<sd>The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of <name type="GPE">Mygeeto</name>. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. <name type="GPE">KI</name>-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER <name type="ORG">BACARA</name> (<name type="ORG">1138</name>) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a <name type="ORG">HOLOGRAM OF</name> DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DARTH SlDIOUS:</speaker> Commander <name type="ORG">1138</name> . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER <name type="ORG">BACARA</name>:</speaker> Yes, sir.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE COMMANDER <name type="ORG">BACARA</name>:</speaker> It will be done, My Lord.</sp>

<sd>DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where <name type="GPE">KI</name>-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge.

<sp><speaker>AAYLA:</speaker> Steady. . . . steady . . .</sp>

<sd>They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER <name type="ORG">BLY</name> moves up behind the Jedi.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AAYLA:</speaker> (continuing) Bly, do you think they're <name type="ORG">Droid</name>s?</sp>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">BLY</name>:</speaker> No.</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">BLY</name> blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER <name type="ORG">CLONES</name> fire on her as she hits the ground.</sd>

<sd>The Jedi <name type="ORG">QUI</name>NLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF <name type="ORG">CLONES</name>.

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.</sd>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> is hiding. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge <name type="ORG">NOS</name> <name type="ORG">MON</name>STER. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the <name type="ORG">NOS</name> <name type="ORG">MON</name>STER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.</sd>

<sd>The <name type="ORG">NOS</name> <name type="ORG">MON</name>STER'S lunge takes him past OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>, out of the cave, and into the water.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AT-ST CLONE <name type="ORG">SERGEANT</name>:</speaker> Everyone out of there!</sp>

<sd>A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> What about Obi-Wan?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> How could this have happened?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> What are you saying?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You need to distance yourself from your friends in the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> Not Anakin! He couldn't!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war.

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I don't believe you ... I can't.</sp>

<sd>SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.</sd>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.</sd>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION <name type="ORG">DROIDS</name>.

The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.</sd>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.</sd>

<sd>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> and ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID.

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N jumps and flips onto OBI- <name type="ORG">WAN</name>'s platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N:</speaker> You underestimate my power!</sp>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N follows, and OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name> cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.</sd>

<sd>ANA<name type="GPE">KI</name>N struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-<name type="ORG">WAN</name>:</speaker> (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, not leave it in Darkness.</sp>
