         <h1>EPISODE IV </h1>
        <h2>"The Imperial Forces -- under orders from cruel Darth Vader -- hold Princess Leia hostage, in their efforts to quell the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Luke Skywalker and Han Solo, captain of the Millennium Falcon, work together with the companionable droid duo R2-D2 and C-3PO to rescue the beautiful princess, help the Rebel Alliance, and restore freedom and justice to the Galaxy."</h2>
        <h2>For the original trilogy, we analyzed when Nationalities or Groups were mentioned in the scripts. For the first movie, the most common one was "Wookie".</h2>

        <h1>EPISODE V </h1>
        <h2>"The adventure continues in this "Star Wars" sequal. Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth. While Han and Leia escape in the Millennium Falcon, Luke travels to Dagobah in search of Yoda. Only with the Jedi master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the Force beckons him into the ultimate duel with Darth Vader."</h2>
        <h2>In this episode, Wookie is still the dominant nationality, but droids follow more closely behind this time.</h2>

            <h1>EPISODE VI </h1>
            <h2>"Luke Skywalker battles horrible Jabba the Hut and cruel Darth Vader to save his comrades in the Rebel Alliance and triumph over the Galactic Empire. Han Solo and Princess Leia reaffirm their love and team with Chewbacca, Lando Calrissian, the Ewoks and the androids C-3PO and R2-D2 to aid in the disruption of the Dark Side and the defeat of the evil emperor."</h2>
        <h2>Lastly, the droids finally take over the wookie for the number one spot. This is likely due to the many scenes that C3PO and R2D2 have in this film.</h2>
