        <h1 style="color:lightblue;">About The Team</h1>
        <h3>The team members for this consisted of Jordan James, Shaun Massenburg, Jaxon Abele, and Zachery Schleger who all contributed
        particular skills to help pull this project together. Over the course of the 2023 Spring Semester, the team constructed this webpage
        and all data on it for their final project in the large scale text analysis class at Penn State Behrend.</h3>
        <h2 style="color:red;">Jordan James</h2>
        <h3>Jordan did a lot of great work working with the html and css to make the website look the way it looks now!</h3>
        <h2 style="color:yellow;">Shaun Massenburg</h2>
        <h3>Shaun worked with the website styling as well and did work getting images onto the site</h3>
        <h2 style="color:orange;">Jax Abele</h2>
        <h3>Jax worked with python to tag to create a code that would tag words throughout the scripts such as names, locations, and organizations
        using this data, he created the scg charts that are displayed on the site using XQuery. In the final stages, Jax finalized and cleaned all html for the site</h3>
        <h2 style="color:pink;">Zach Schleger</h2>
        <h3>Zach did great work with python and was able to tag all of the verbs in the script and use these to create a very interesting analysis
        on the character of Anakin Skywalker and his fall to the dark side. Zach also used Regex to make sure that all of the initial xml elements 
        in our script were properly and efficiently tagged!</h3>
