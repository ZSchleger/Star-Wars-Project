<setting>1 EXT. SPACE</setting>

<crawl>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.</crawl>

<sd>A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.</sd>

<crawl>War! The Republic <verb lemma="be">is</verb> <verb lemma="crumble">crumbling</verb> under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, <verb lemma="count">Count</verb> Dooku. There <verb lemma="be">are</verb> heroes on both sides. Evil <verb lemma="be">is</verb> everywhere.

In a stunning move, the fiendish <verb lemma="droid">droid</verb> leader, General Grievous, <verb lemma="have">has</verb> <verb lemma="sweep">swept</verb> into the Republic capital and <verb lemma="kidnap">kidnapped</verb> Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate.

As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to <verb lemma="flee">flee</verb> the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights <verb lemma="lead">lead</verb> a desperate mission to <verb lemma="rescue">rescue</verb> the captive Chancellor. . . .
</crawl>

<sd>PAN DOWN to <verb lemma="reveal">reveal</verb> a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. <verb lemma="continue">Continue</verb> to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and <verb lemma="head">head</verb> toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they <verb lemma="maneuver">maneuver</verb> in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 <verb lemma="be">is</verb> on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 <verb lemma="be">is</verb> on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space <verb lemma="battle">battle</verb> <verb lemma="be">is</verb> revealed as the tiny Jedi ships <verb lemma="continue">continue</verb> their assault in a synchronous ballet.</sd>

<setting>2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sd>OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> rocks violently.</sd>

<setting>3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sd>ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> There isn't a <verb lemma="droid">droid</verb> <verb lemma="make">made</verb> that can out <verb lemma="fly">fly</verb> you, Master, and no other way to <verb lemma="get">get</verb> to the Chancellor . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="look">Look</verb> out, four droids inbound . . .</sp>

<setting>4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE</setting>

<sd>The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS <verb lemma="swerve">swerve</verb> in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS <verb lemma="collide">collide</verb> with each other in a ball of flame.</sd>

<setting>5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sd>OBI-WAN struggles to maintain <verb lemma="control">control</verb> of his ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> We've got to split them up.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="break">Break</verb> left, <verb lemma="fly">fly</verb> through the guns on that tower.</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN <verb lemma="fly">flies</verb> to the <verb lemma="leave">left</verb> of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Easy for you to <verb lemma="say">say</verb> . . . why am I always the bait?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS <verb lemma="stay">stay</verb> on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Anakin, they're all over me!</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Dead ahead! Closing . . . <verb lemma="lock">lock</verb> onto him, Artoo . . .</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN <verb lemma="swoop">swoops</verb> in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I copy, Artoo.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> I'm going down on the deck.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Good idea ... I <verb lemma="need">need</verb> some room to maneuver.</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and <verb lemma="be">is</verb> forced to <verb lemma="fly">fly</verb> through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which <verb lemma="be">is</verb> followed by ANAKIN.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> (continuing) <verb lemma="cut">Cut</verb> right. <verb lemma="do">Do</verb> you <verb lemma="hear">hear</verb> me?! <verb lemma="cut">Cut</verb> right. Don't <verb lemma="let">let</verb> him <verb lemma="get">get</verb> a handle on you. <verb lemma="come">Come</verb> on, Artoo, <verb lemma="lock">lock</verb> on! <verb lemma="lock">Lock</verb> on!</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs <verb lemma="merge">merge</verb> on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="hurry">Hurry</verb> up! I don't <verb lemma="like">like</verb> this!</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN <verb lemma="fly">flies</verb> through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> <verb lemma="go">go</verb> flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> (continuing) Ouch!</sp>

<sd>R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> (continuing) Don't even <verb lemma="try">try</verb> to <verb lemma="fix">fix</verb> it, Arfour. I've <verb lemma="shut">shut</verb> it down.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> We're locked on ... we've got him . . .</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's <verb lemma="find">find</verb> the Command Ship and <verb lemma="get">get</verb> on with it ...</sp>

<sd>R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="lock">Lock</verb> onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> <verb lemma="be">is</verb> directly ahead.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.</sp>

<setting>6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> I <verb lemma="see">see</verb> it. Oh, this <verb lemma="be">is</verb> going to <verb lemma="be">be</verb> easy.</sp>

<sd>Ahead <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS <verb lemma="stalk">stalking</verb> around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS trans<verb lemma="form">form</verb> into flight configuration, <verb lemma="lift">lift</verb> off the CRUISER, and <verb lemma="attack">attack</verb> the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="come">Come</verb> on, Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Not this time. There's too much at stake. We <verb lemma="need">need</verb> help. Odd Ball, <verb lemma="do">do</verb> you copy?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL:</speaker> (OS) Copy, Red Leader.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Mark my <verb lemma="position">position</verb> and <verb lemma="form">form</verb> your squad up behind me . . .</sp>

<setting>7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL:</speaker> We're on your tail, General Kenobi. <verb lemma="set">Set</verb> S-foils in <verb lemma="attack">attack</verb> position.</sp>

<sd>The protective ray <verb lemma="shield">shield</verb> lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS <verb lemma="emerge">emerge</verb> and <verb lemma="join">join</verb> the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.</sd>

<setting>8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE</setting>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> This <verb lemma="be">is</verb> where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the <verb lemma="leave">left</verb> side.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS a <verb lemma="worry">worried</verb> message.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="add">Add</verb> five Tri-fighters on the right . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I'm going <verb lemma="head">head</verb> to head. <verb lemma="see">See</verb> you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="take">Take</verb> it easy, Anakin.</sp>

<sd>Four Clone Fighters <verb lemma="move">move</verb> into formation behind the Jedi.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL:</speaker> I'm on your right, Red Leader.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Incoming!!</sp>

<sd>ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS <verb lemma="pass">pass</verb> by at high <verb lemma="speed">speed</verb> on the right.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Five more on the right!</sp>

<sd>Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS <verb lemma="pass">pass</verb> at high <verb lemma="speed">speed</verb> from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN <verb lemma="continue">continue</verb> to <verb lemma="fly">fly</verb> in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Here we go.</sp>

<sd>The Jedi ships split up and <verb lemma="make">make</verb> a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> I'm going high and right.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="hang">Hang</verb> on. There <verb lemma="be">are</verb> four more of them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="stay">Stay</verb> with me . . . <verb lemma="swing">swing</verb> <verb lemma="back">back</verb> and right . . . <verb lemma="help">help</verb> me engage. Back off ... <verb lemma="let">Let</verb> them <verb lemma="pass">pass</verb> between us.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids <verb lemma="be">are</verb> all over me <verb lemma="like">like</verb> a rash.</sp>

<sd>In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there <verb lemma="be">is</verb> only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.</sd>

<sd>ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN <verb lemma="accelerate">accelerate</verb>s past the <verb lemma="last">last</verb> DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they <verb lemma="fly">fly</verb> through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> How many <verb lemma="back">back</verb> there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Anakin, you <verb lemma="have">have</verb> four on your tail.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I know. I know!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Four more <verb lemma="close">closing</verb> from your left.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I know. I know!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="break">Break</verb> right and <verb lemma="go">go</verb> high.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I'm going low and left.</sp>

<sd>Obi-Wan shakes his head.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> (to himself) He still <verb lemma="have">has</verb> much to learn.</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN <verb lemma="swoop">swoops</verb> low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to <verb lemma="get">get</verb> out a sentence.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="hang">Hang</verb> on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, <verb lemma="do">do</verb> you copy? I'm going to <verb lemma="pull">pull</verb> them through the needle . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Sorry, no choice. <verb lemma="come">Come</verb> down here and <verb lemma="thin">thin</verb> them out a little.</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS <verb lemma="chase">chasing</verb> Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Just <verb lemma="keep">keep</verb> me steady . . . <verb lemma="hold">hold</verb> on ... not yet. . . now <verb lemma="break">break</verb> left.</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the <verb lemma="back">back</verb> of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He <verb lemma="fly">flies</verb> into the trench, which ends in a <verb lemma="con">conning</verb> tower with a small slit between two main struts.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> (continuing) You'll never <verb lemma="get">get</verb> through there, Anakin. It's too tight.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO BEEPS nervously.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="use">Use</verb> the Force, think yourself through, the <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> will follow.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Wrong thought, Artoo.</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> (continuing) I'm through.</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN continues to <verb lemma="fire">fire</verb> on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, <verb lemma="drive">driving</verb> them into the EXPLOSION.
A CLONE fighter <verb lemma="be">is</verb> <verb lemma="hit">hit</verb> and explodes, <verb lemma="spew">spewing</verb> debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.
Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ODD BALL:</speaker> There <verb lemma="be">are</verb> too many of them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CLONE PILOT 2:</speaker> I'm on your wing. <verb lemma="break">Break</verb> left. <verb lemma="break">Break</verb> left. They're all over me. <verb lemma="get">Get</verb> them off my . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I'm going to <verb lemma="go">go</verb> <verb lemma="help">help</verb> them out!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> No, no! They <verb lemma="be">are</verb> doing their job so we can <verb lemma="do">do</verb> ours. Head for the Command Ship!</sp>

<sd>Another CLONE fighter <verb lemma="be">is</verb> hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its <verb lemma="head">head</verb> to locate its target and fires missiles at them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Missiles! <verb lemma="pull">Pull</verb> up!</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN <verb lemma="break">break</verb> right and left, and the missiles <verb lemma="follow">follow</verb> them. ANAKIN does a barrel <verb lemma="roll">roll</verb> spin, <verb lemma="cause">causing</verb> the missiles following him to <verb lemma="collide">collide</verb> and EXPLODE. Two missiles <verb lemma="continue">continue</verb> to <verb lemma="chase">chase</verb> OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, <verb lemma="cause">causing</verb> one of the missiles to overshoot.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> They overshot us . . .</sp>

<sd>The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wan�s Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter <verb lemma="rip">rips</verb> through the explosion. Debris <verb lemma="fly">flies</verb> all around them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> They're coming around!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="surge">Surge</verb> all power units. Artoo! <verb lemma="stand">Stand</verb> by the <verb lemma="reverse">reverse</verb> thrusters.</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles <verb lemma="spin">spin</verb> and collide.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> We got 'em. Artoo!</sp>

<sd>Two missiles <verb lemma="continue">continue</verb> to <verb lemma="track">track</verb> Obi-Wan.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Flying <verb lemma="be">is</verb> for droids.</sp>

<sd>Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles <verb lemma="fly">fly</verb> into what looks <verb lemma="like">like</verb> debris, and detonate. Five silver balls <verb lemma="fly">fly</verb> out of the debris and <verb lemma="attach">attach</verb> themselves to the ship. The balls <verb lemma="pop">pop</verb> open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to <verb lemma="crawl">crawl</verb> across the surface <verb lemma="like">like</verb> spiders.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I <verb lemma="see">see</verb> them . . . Buzz Droids.</sp>

<sd>The BUZZ DROIDS <verb lemma="crawl">crawl</verb> across Obi-Wan's <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> and <verb lemma="start">start</verb> to <verb lemma="tear">tear</verb> it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS <verb lemma="break">break</verb> into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Arfour, <verb lemma="be">be</verb> careful. You <verb lemma="have">have</verb> one . . .</sp>

<sd>ARFOUR's <verb lemma="head">head</verb> gets <verb lemma="rip">ripped</verb> off and <verb lemma="fly">flies</verb> away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="move">Move</verb> to the right so I can <verb lemma="get">get</verb> a <verb lemma="clear">clear</verb> <verb lemma="shoot">shot</verb> at them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> The mission. <verb lemma="get">Get</verb> to the Command Ship. <verb lemma="get">Get</verb> the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN moves into <verb lemma="position">position</verb> just off Obi-Wan's <verb lemma="leave">left</verb> <verb lemma="side">side</verb> and <verb lemma="angle">angles</verb> his <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> so his guns <verb lemma="be">are</verb> pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wan�s Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and <verb lemma="vaporize">vaporizes</verb> the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the <verb lemma="leave">left</verb> wing of Obi-Wan's ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> (continuing) In the name of ...</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Steady . . . steady . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Anakin, <verb lemma="hold">hold</verb> your <verb lemma="fire">fire</verb> . . . <verb lemma="hold">hold</verb> your fire. You're not helping here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I agree, bad idea. <verb lemma="swing">Swing</verb> right . . . <verb lemma="ease">ease</verb> over . . . steady . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="wait">Wait</verb> . . . wait . . . I can't <verb lemma="see">see</verb> a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="move">Move</verb> to the right.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="hold">Hold</verb> on, Anakin. You're going to <verb lemma="get">get</verb> us both killed! <verb lemma="get">Get</verb> out of here. There's nothing more you can do.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I'm not <verb lemma="leave">leaving</verb> without you, Master.</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN moves his <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> next to OBI-WAN's and <verb lemma="try">tries</verb> to physically <verb lemma="knock">knock</verb> the BUZZ DROIDS off. There <verb lemma="be">are</verb> five left. He <verb lemma="manage">manages</verb> to <verb lemma="get">get</verb> one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the <verb lemma="front">front</verb> of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames <verb lemma="burst">burst</verb> out, and more smoke <verb lemma="billow">billows</verb> out, <verb lemma="obscure">obscuring</verb> the Jedi's view.</sd>

<sd>ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="blast">Blast</verb> it ... I can't <verb lemma="see">see</verb> . . . my controls <verb lemma="be">are</verb> gone.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="get">Get</verb> 'em, Artoo. <verb lemma="watch">Watch</verb> out!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Artoo, <verb lemma="hit">hit</verb> the buzz droid's <verb lemma="center">center</verb> eye.</sp>

<sd>ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the <verb lemma="swerve">swerving</verb> BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID <verb lemma="be">is</verb> <verb lemma="hit">hit</verb> squarely in the <verb lemma="eye">eye</verb> and falls off the ship.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Yeah, you got him!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Great, Artoo.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="stay">Stay</verb> on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship <verb lemma="be">is</verb> dead ahead. Easy . . . <verb lemma="pull">pull</verb> up ... Head for the hangar.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> <verb lemma="have">Have</verb> you noticed the shields <verb lemma="be">are</verb> still up?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Oh?!? Sorry, Master.</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's <verb lemma="disintegrate">disintegrating</verb> Jedi Fighter and blasts the <verb lemma="shield">shield</verb> generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Oh, I <verb lemma="have">have</verb> a bad feeling about this.</sp>

<setting>9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>The <verb lemma="shield">shield</verb> door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A <verb lemma="set">set</verb> of <verb lemma="blast">blast</verb> doors starts SLAMMING <verb lemma="shut">shut</verb> across the hangar opening, as material <verb lemma="be">is</verb> <verb lemma="suck">sucked</verb> into space.</sd>

<sd>ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and <verb lemma="fly">flies</verb> into the hangar just as the <verb lemma="blast">blast</verb> doors SLAM shut.
OBI-WAN ignites his <verb lemma="light">light</verb> saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS <verb lemma="rush">rush</verb> at him from all directions.</sd>

<sd>ANAKIN jumps out of his <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN <verb lemma="be">is</verb> fighting. ARTOO pops out of the <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> and follows ANAKIN.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Artoo, locate the Chancellor.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Tap into the ship's computers.</sp>

<sd>They <verb lemma="cut">cut</verb> down the <verb lemma="last">last</verb> of the droids and <verb lemma="follow">follow</verb> ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI <verb lemma="fight">fight</verb> off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO <verb lemma="try">tries</verb> to <verb lemma="find">find</verb> the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> appears.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> The Chancellor's signal <verb lemma="be">is</verb> coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I sense <verb lemma="count">Count</verb> Dooku . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> I sense a trap.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Next move?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Spring the trap.</sp>

<sd>The JEDI <verb lemma="start">start</verb> to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI <verb lemma="stop">stop</verb> and <verb lemma="turn">turn</verb> to ARTOO.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Artoo, <verb lemma="go">go</verb> back. I <verb lemma="need">need</verb> you to <verb lemma="stay">stay</verb> with the ship.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Here, <verb lemma="take">take</verb> this, and wait for orders.</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN tosses the <verb lemma="comlink">comlink</verb> to ARTOO.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BODYGUARD I:</speaker> General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> We <verb lemma="be">are</verb> here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not <verb lemma="join">join</verb> him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Anakin. . .</sp>

<setting>12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER</setting>

<sd>The TWO JEDI <verb lemma="cut">cut</verb> their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the <verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> <verb lemma="have">have</verb> caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid <verb lemma="be">is</verb> <verb lemma="spew">spewing</verb> everywhere.

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Well then, we're safe for the time being.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Your idea of safe <verb lemma="be">is</verb> not the same as mine.</sp>

<sd>They run, EXPLOSIONS <verb lemma="rattle">rattle</verb> the ship, and pipes <verb lemma="continue">continue</verb> to <verb lemma="burst">burst</verb> around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS <verb lemma="drop">drop</verb> into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They <verb lemma="pass">pass</verb> several large power generators, which <verb lemma="be">are</verb> <verb lemma="top">topped</verb> with SPARKING excess power dischargers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> They're sealing this section off.</sp>

<sd>They <verb lemma="move">move</verb> along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the <verb lemma="side">side</verb> to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> We'll never <verb lemma="get">get</verb> through that. It's too small!</sp>

<sd>They <verb lemma="move">move</verb> toward a second vent. OBI-WAN <verb lemma="be">is</verb> swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and <verb lemma="try">tries</verb> to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN <verb lemma="be">is</verb> forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he <verb lemma="be">is</verb> about to drown, OBI-WAN <verb lemma="disable">disables</verb> the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.</sd>

<sd>The fuel <verb lemma="be">is</verb> up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Everyone will <verb lemma="agree">agree</verb> on that.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Anakin, I've known you since you <verb lemma="be">were</verb> a small boy. I <verb lemma="have">have</verb> advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You <verb lemma="have">have</verb> <verb lemma="win">won</verb> many battles the Jedi Council <verb lemma="think">thought</verb> <verb lemma="be">were</verb> <verb lemma="lose">lost</verb> . . . and you saved my life. I <verb lemma="hope">hope</verb> you <verb lemma="trust">trust</verb> me, Anakin.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Of course.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I <verb lemma="need">need</verb> your help, son.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> What <verb lemma="do">do</verb> you mean?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I <verb lemma="fear">fear</verb> the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're <verb lemma="shroud">shrouded</verb> in secrecy and <verb lemma="obsess">obsessed</verb> with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I <verb lemma="find">find</verb> simply incomprehensible in a democracy.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I can <verb lemma="assure">assure</verb> you that the Jedi <verb lemma="be">are</verb> dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Nevertheless, their actions will <verb lemma="speak">speak</verb> more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> For what? I don't understand.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> To <verb lemma="be">be</verb> the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN thinks about this.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) Anakin . . . I'm <verb lemma="appoint">appointing</verb> you to <verb lemma="be">be</verb> my personal representative on the Jedi Council.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never <verb lemma="accept">accept</verb> this.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I think they will . . . they <verb lemma="need">need</verb> you more than you know.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME:</speaker> I can't believe it <verb lemma="have">has</verb> <verb lemma="come">come</verb> to this! Chancellor Palpatine <verb lemma="be">is</verb> one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I <verb lemma="be">was</verb> Queen.</sp>

<sd>Anakin reacts with anger.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> What? ! How can you <verb lemma="do">do</verb> this?? This <verb lemma="be">is</verb> outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you <verb lemma="be">be</verb> on the Council and not <verb lemma="be">be</verb> a Master?</sp>

<sp><speaker>MACE:</speaker> <verb lemma="take">Take</verb> a seat, young Skywalker.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> <verb lemma="forgive">Forgive</verb> me, Master.</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone <verb lemma="be">is</verb> embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MACE:</speaker> We cannot <verb lemma="take">take</verb> ships from the <verb lemma="front">front</verb> line.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> Master Kenobi, our <verb lemma="spy">spies</verb> contact, you must, and then wait.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MACE:</speaker> It <verb lemma="be">is</verb> critical we send an <verb lemma="attack">attack</verb> group there, immediately!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> He's right, that <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a system we cannot <verb lemma="afford">afford</verb> to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I <verb lemma="know">know</verb> that system well. It would <verb lemma="take">take</verb> us little time to <verb lemma="drive">drive</verb> the droids off that planet.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MACE:</speaker> Skywalker, your assignment <verb lemma="be">is</verb> here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must <verb lemma="find">find</verb> General Grievous.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA:</speaker> Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MACE:</speaker> It <verb lemma="be">is</verb> settled then. Yoda will <verb lemma="take">take</verb> a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force <verb lemma="be">be</verb> with us all.</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN and OBI-WAN <verb lemma="walk">walk</verb> through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN <verb lemma="be">is</verb> furious.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> What kind of nonsense <verb lemma="be">is</verb> this, <verb lemma="put">put</verb> me on the Council and not <verb lemma="make">make</verb> me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Calm down, Anakin. You <verb lemma="have">have</verb> been given a great honor. To <verb lemma="be">be</verb> on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. <verb lemma="listen">List<verb lemma="en">en</verb></verb> to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter <verb lemma="be">is</verb> you're too <verb lemma="close">close</verb> to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't <verb lemma="like">like</verb> it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I <verb lemma="swear">swear</verb> to you, I didn't <verb lemma="ask">ask</verb> to <verb lemma="be">be</verb> <verb lemma="put">put</verb> on the Council . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> But it's what you wanted! Your friend<verb lemma="ship">ship</verb> with Chancellor Palpatine seems to <verb lemma="have">have</verb> paid off.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> That <verb lemma="have">has</verb> nothing to <verb lemma="do">do</verb> with this.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you <verb lemma="find">find</verb> yourself in a delicate situation.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> You <verb lemma="mean">mean</verb> divided loyalties.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> I warned you there <verb lemma="be">was</verb> tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I <verb lemma="be">was</verb> very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> The Council <verb lemma="be">is</verb> upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> No, it <verb lemma="be">is</verb> not. Anakin, I <verb lemma="worry">worry</verb> when you <verb lemma="speak">speak</verb> of jealousy and pride. Those <verb lemma="be">are</verb> not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Master, you of all people should <verb lemma="have">have</verb> confidence in my abilities. I <verb lemma="know">know</verb> where my loyalties lie.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> I <verb lemma="hope">hope</verb> so . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I sense there's more to this <verb lemma="talk">talk</verb> than you're saying.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Anakin, the only reason the Council <verb lemma="have">has</verb> approved your appointment <verb lemma="be">is</verb> because the Chancellor trusts you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> And?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't <verb lemma="want">want</verb> to <verb lemma="see">see</verb> you <verb lemma="put">put</verb> in this situation.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> What situation?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to <verb lemma="report">report</verb> on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They <verb lemma="want">want</verb> to <verb lemma="know">know</verb> what he's up to.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> They <verb lemma="want">want</verb> me to <verb lemma="spy">spy</verb> on the Chancellor? That's treason!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> We <verb lemma="be">are</verb> at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council <verb lemma="be">is</verb> <verb lemma="swear">sworn</verb> to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Why didn't the Council <verb lemma="give">give</verb> me this assignment when we <verb lemma="be">were</verb> in session?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> This assignment <verb lemma="be">is</verb> not to <verb lemma="be">be</verb> on record. The Council asked me to <verb lemma="approach">approach</verb> you on this personally.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> The Chancellor <verb lemma="be">is</verb> not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> That <verb lemma="be">is</verb> why you must <verb lemma="help">help</verb> us, Anakin.

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Master, the Sen<verb lemma="eat">ate</verb> demanded that he <verb lemma="stay">stay</verb> longer.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> Yes, but <verb lemma="use">use</verb> your feelings, Anakin. Something <verb lemma="be">is</verb> out of place.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> You're asking me to <verb lemma="do">do</verb> something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why <verb lemma="be">are</verb> you asking this of me?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> You must sense what I <verb lemma="have">have</verb> <verb lemma="come">come</verb> to <verb lemma="suspect">suspect</verb> . . . the Jedi Council <verb lemma="want">want</verb> <verb lemma="control">control</verb> of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I <verb lemma="know">know</verb> they don't <verb lemma="trust">trust</verb> you . . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Or the Sen<verb lemma="eat">ate</verb> . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I <verb lemma="have">have</verb> to <verb lemma="admit">admit</verb> my <verb lemma="trust">trust</verb> in them <verb lemma="have">has</verb> been shaken.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Why? They asked you to <verb lemma="do">do</verb> something that <verb lemma="make">made</verb> you <verb lemma="feel">feel</verb> dishonest, didn't they?</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN doesn't <verb lemma="say">say</verb> anything. He simply looks down.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) They asked you to <verb lemma="spy">spy</verb> on me, didn't they?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I don't <verb lemma="know">know</verb> ... I don't <verb lemma="know">know</verb> what to say.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> <verb lemma="remember">Remember</verb> <verb lemma="back">back</verb> to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power <verb lemma="be">are</verb> <verb lemma="afraid">afraid</verb> to <verb lemma="lose">lose</verb> it." Even the Jedi.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> The Jedi <verb lemma="use">use</verb> their power for good.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Good <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a <verb lemma="point">point</verb> of view, Anakin. And the Jedi <verb lemma="point">point</verb> of view <verb lemma="be">is</verb> not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they <verb lemma="be">are</verb> considered by the Jedi to be. . .</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> . . . evil.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> . . . from a Jedi's <verb lemma="point">point</verb> of view. The Sith and the Jedi <verb lemma="be">are</verb> similar in almost every way, <verb lemma="include">including</verb> their quest for greater power. The difference between the two <verb lemma="be">is</verb> the Sith <verb lemma="be">are</verb> not <verb lemma="afraid">afraid</verb> of the dark <verb lemma="side">side</verb> of the Force. That <verb lemma="be">is</verb> why they <verb lemma="be">are</verb> more powerful.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> The Sith <verb lemma="rely">rely</verb> on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> And the Jedi don't?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> The Jedi <verb lemma="be">are</verb> selfless . . . they only care about others.</sp>

<sd>PALPATINE smiles.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Or so you've been trained to believe. Why <verb lemma="be">is</verb> it, then, that they <verb lemma="have">have</verb> asked you to <verb lemma="do">do</verb> something you <verb lemma="feel">feel</verb> <verb lemma="be">is</verb> wrong?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> I'm not <verb lemma="sure">sure</verb> it's wrong.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> <verb lemma="have">Have</verb> they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. <verb lemma="consider">Consider</verb> their motives. <verb lemma="keep">Keep</verb> your <verb lemma="mind">mind</verb> <verb lemma="clear">clear</verb> of assumptions. The <verb lemma="fear">fear</verb> of <verb lemma="lose">losing</verb> power <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN <verb lemma="be">is</verb> deep in thought.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> (continuing) <verb lemma="do">Did</verb> you ever <verb lemma="hear">hear</verb> the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> No.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> I <verb lemma="think">thought</verb> not. It's not a story the Jedi would <verb lemma="tell">tell</verb> you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis <verb lemma="be">was</verb> a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could <verb lemma="use">use</verb> the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He <verb lemma="have">had</verb> such a knowledge of the dark <verb lemma="side">side</verb> that he could even <verb lemma="keep">keep</verb> the ones he cared about from dying.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> He could actually <verb lemma="save">save</verb> people from death?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> The dark <verb lemma="side">side</verb> of the Force <verb lemma="be">is</verb> a pathway to many abilities some <verb lemma="consider">consider</verb> to <verb lemma="be">be</verb> unnatural.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> What happened to him?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> He became so powerful . . . the only thing he <verb lemma="be">was</verb> <verb lemma="afraid">afraid</verb> of <verb lemma="be">was</verb> <verb lemma="lose">losing</verb> his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he <verb lemma="teach">taught</verb> his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never <verb lemma="see">saw</verb> it coming. It's ironic he could <verb lemma="save">save</verb> others from death, but not himself.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN:</speaker> Is it possible to <verb lemma="learn">learn</verb> this power?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE:</speaker> Not from a Jedi.</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway <verb lemma="cut">cut</verb> into the <verb lemma="side">side</verb> of the sinkhole. It's hard to <verb lemma="see">see</verb> him. In an alcove, he carefully <verb lemma="survey">surveys</verb> the city, then quickly moves on.</sd>

<setting>109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY</setting>

He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS <verb lemma="be">are</verb> standing around.
OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight <verb lemma="hand">hand</verb> movements.</sd>

<sd>One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and <verb lemma="chatter">chatters</verb> away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> This one.</sp>

<sd>The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>WRANGLER:</speaker> Boga. She answers to Boga.</sp>

<sd>About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
They stare at each other for a moment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>GENERAL GRIEVOUS:</speaker> Enough of this.</sp>

<sd>The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to <verb lemma="knock">knock</verb> OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head.

His staff <verb lemma="fly">flies</verb> into the air and <verb lemma="be">is</verb> <verb lemma="catch">caught</verb> by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS <verb lemma="attack">attack</verb> OBI-WAN with an intense fury.
OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the <verb lemma="last">last</verb> BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS <verb lemma="move">move</verb> toward OBI-WAN.</sd>

<sp><speaker>GENERAL GRIEVOUS:</speaker> Back away. I will <verb lemma="deal">deal</verb> with this Jedi slime myself.</sp>

<sd>OBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES <verb lemma="pop">pop</verb> out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto.

<sd>The NOS MONSTER'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water.</sd>

<sd>The SECOND SEEKER <verb lemma="shine">shines</verb> its <verb lemma="light">light</verb> on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature <verb lemma="try">tries</verb> to <verb lemma="grab">grab</verb> the LITTLE DRONE.

<sd>ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.</sd>

<sd>ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his <verb lemma="leave">left</verb> arm in the <verb lemma="blink">blink</verb> of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a <verb lemma="stop">stop</verb> near the edge of the lava.</sd>

<sd>ANAKIN struggles to <verb lemma="pull">pull</verb> himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His <verb lemma="thin">thin</verb> leather glove <verb lemma="have">has</verb> been burned off. He keeps <verb lemma="slide">sliding</verb> down in the black sand.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN:</speaker> You <verb lemma="be">were</verb> my brother, Anakin. I loved you.</sp>
